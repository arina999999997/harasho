This is where you want to go, right? Wow~, I didn’t know there’s a place like this in Tokyo.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eHeh.... There are simply places you can’t find without magical powers. One of which would be here, the fountain of magic....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eEh? Didn’t the sign in the park say it was a pond?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003ePo-.... It’s better to let normal humans think it’s a pond. If they find out that this is a source of magical energy, they will panic, won’t they?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eHmm, I see.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eHonoka, I shall reward you for taking me here and being an excellent little demon. Here, some bread. Take it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eEh, bread!? Yaaay~! ....Wait, Yoshiko-chan!? I-, isn’t this bread the one where you have to line up for at least 30 minutes even if you go at their opening time!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eEh? Well, I did line up, but.... Wait, it’s not Yoshiko, it’s Yohane! Just take it, would you?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eAaaah! I love you, Yoshiko-chan!! I’ll take you anywhere you want, so just invite me again sometimes, okay~!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eLike I said, it’s not Yoshi-.... Hey! Stop clinging to me! It’s embarrassing!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
