She also shows some thoughtfulness.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eWow~, that’s amazing. As for Shiitake.... She barks a lot when she wants food....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eIt’s impressive how she can tell you when she wants food. Ophelia sounds smart even by her name alone.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eFufu! Your pet, Alan, also has a wonderful name, Rina-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eIt’s a very city-like name for a pet~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eEhehe. Alan is also a very smart and cute girl. But it must be nice to have fluffy pets who let you cuddle them like Ophelia and Shiitake.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eShiitake is very gentle and stays put no matter how much you cuddle her. Ophelia gets excited so easily....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eAhaha! Shiitake always goes *wham* on me~. Whenever I’m tired of doing homework, she lets me cuddle her up.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eMaybe I should put a fluffy module on Alan too....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eWaaah! Let me cuddle her then, okay!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
