To have all 28 members gathered here for me…. I haven’t had this many people attending my birthday since kindergarten. Ah, the kindergarten one was a collective birthday celebration for everyone that has their birthday in October, though….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003ePuh…. Fufufu.
