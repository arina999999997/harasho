Thank you. Umm, may I ask how it was? I’ve never done a stream by myself, so I couldn’t really tell.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eI’m happy that I got to see your bedtime routine, Eli-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eI’m glad. But that wasn’t what I was asking for.... Were you able to get something from it? I consulted with Nozomi about it, but did you find my skincare ways and stretches useful?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eUseful....? Umm, I thought you were really cute with your forehead hanging out while you were doing your skincare, Eli-chan~. Even though you’re usually so dignified, you looked a bit like a little girl that I just wanted to hug you.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eA-....a little girl? Is that so?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eNozomi-chan is amazing.

I’ll give more thought about the contents of future streams.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eEeeh!? But I want to see more of your cute side, Eli-chan!
