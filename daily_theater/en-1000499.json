You want to send a greeting card to someone, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eOooh! As expected of Eli-chan! You’re mo~stly right, but there’s something else.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eSomething else?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eYou see, I do want to write a greeting card, but I want to use that greeting card as an invitation to a summer greeting party!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eA summer greeting party....
