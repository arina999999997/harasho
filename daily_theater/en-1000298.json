Umi-chan’s lecture must’ve been long~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eAhaha, it might have been quite long. But Umi-chan must’ve been really worried about her too, right\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eSpeaking of which, I think our Chika-chan got into similar situations like that. And every time she did, Kanan-chan would lecture her~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eThey’re just so reckless and make you anxious, huh. But....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eAh, I think I understand that feeling. But we still want them to keep looking forward and run with all their might, don’t we....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eThat’s right! I want them to strive for greatness and keep running. If they’re about to fall down, then we can just hold them up\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eEven if they did fall down, they would just get up all okay, right!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eFufu, that’s true. I want them to stay the way they are forever and ever\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eYeah! Anxiously watching over them has also become somewhat fun, hasn’t it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
