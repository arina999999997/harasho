Cleaning your room and doing laundry while listening to music. Then have bread, eggs, and vegetable soup for breakfast.... You’re living the dream~!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eY-.... you think so?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eYou also made sandwiches for lunch, right?
