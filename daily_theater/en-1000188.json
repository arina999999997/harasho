Can I stay over at your dorm room? Last time, when I stayed over at Emma-san’s room, I felt that living together with a friend was really fun…. Ah, of course, there are also plenty of hardships and loneliness that comes with leaving your parents’ house….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eIs that all? If you want to ask me for something like that, just ask it normally. You’re always welcome. With that said, that request doesn’t count. But, you can stay over at my room tonight, Setsuna. Let’s also get Emma and pull an all-nighter! You can think of what to ask for until tonight, okay\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI’m so happy!
