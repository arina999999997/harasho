Kanata-chan, can you help me come up with some ideas?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eHuh, can I really help!? I love coming up with menus~! Let’s do it~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhaha, that’s very reassuring.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eSo what have you thought of so far?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThings like yakisoba, takoyaki, and shaved ice. I wonder if people would want teppanyaki dishes…\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eTeppanyaki, huh~... How about getting fresh fish and shellfish and making seafood skewers out of them? The ingredients would be easy to handle, and you could cook stuff like yakisoba alongside them.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eSeafood skewers, huh? Good idea! Thinking about how to handle the ingredients shows that you know food coordination well.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eI make sure never to waste food~♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhaha! But I agree, that’s really important! Alright, so for our sweet dish, how about freshly squeezed juice? If we squeeze the juice out after ordering it, that wouldn’t be wasteful, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eWow, that looks good! I want to come try it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
