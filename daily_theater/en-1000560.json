So I guess we should wrap up today’s independent training here.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eYeah, thanks for today, Karin. I’ll start doing the stretches you taught me immediately today.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eSure. It’s important to keep doing them every day, so by all means, go for it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eOf course! Nico will spare no effort to become an even more perfect school idol than ever.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eFufu, that’s the spirit! I really enjoy talking to you too, Nico-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003e?

I can’t believe you taught me everything about the stretches.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eDon’t worry, because I’ll also steal your techniques next time, Nico-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
