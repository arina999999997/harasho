Just because we just had practice doesn’t mean it’s okay to eat that many sweets before dinner.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eEhehe, you found me~. Riko-chan and You-chan gave me these today. They said it’s for White Day.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThen that’s all the more reason to hold back on eating them, you know?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eOkay~. I’ll make this one my last~. *Munch*. Hnn~, so good!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eGeez. You really are a shrewd one~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eDoes that mean I’m smart?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eIt does not! *Sigh*. Oh well.

Here, take it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eEh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eYou gave me some cookies for White Day earlier, remember? Here’s something in return. I guess we all ended up giving each other something both on Valentine’s and White Day, huh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eWaaah, thank you! Giving sweets to each other is fun~! All the ones you get from other people taste 10 times as good, after all! With that said, can I please eat just one of these, Kanan-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
