It’s rare to see you sigh, Honoka.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eYou see, I asked Mari-san if her heli could take our alpacas to an open place. But they were over the weight limit, so we couldn’t do it. But I really want to let them run around somewhere spacious~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eYou can’t take alpacas on a heli? Well, that makes sense.... But Lanzhu is touched by your kindness in wanting to give them somewhere to run around! Lanzhu will help you come up with something!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eReally!? Thank you, Lanzhu-chan~! Is there a good way to do it? I was thinking of borrowing a big trolley and using it to carry them....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eHmm.... But wouldn’t that be dangerous on big roads with lots of cars?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eI guess that’s true~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eThat’s it! We can just build a ranch in Otonokizaka!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eEeeeeh!? In Otonokizaka!? Uwaaah, that sounds extremely fun! If we can build one, I want to raise goats, sheep, and cows and make ice cream with the milk!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eThat’s great! Wait a minute, Lanzhu will ask Emma how to raise goats!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
