It’s vacation-.... No, summer break, after all. We have to enjoy the most out of it, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eRight, you also have a vacation period in Switzerland, huh. What do you usually do over there?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eHmm, a lot of people go on a trip or just relax in nature.
