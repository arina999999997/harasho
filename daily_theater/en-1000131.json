Please let me watch next time♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYou’re welcome to watch, but…. Actually, it’s quite hard to do everything improvised….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eSo you’re saying it’s better to have a script?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYeah. It’s fun to do improvised plays, but I still enjoy going through each line of a script….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003e….Then, I have an idea, Shizuku-san! We can make our own script!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eEeh!? I hadn’t thought of that…. But that may be a good idea!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eA conflict between an angel and a fallen angel…. There’s no theme more moving than that. That’s right, shall we get Hanamaru-san’s, Riko-san’s, and Umi-san’s help? I think it will be interesting to bring in perspective from people who like books!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThat seems like it will be an amazing script…. Setsuna-san, let’s contact them immediately!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
