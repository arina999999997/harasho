We have a chocolate exchange party tomorrow! Also, I figured if I make extras, I can bring some refreshments for the Aqours live today.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eWhat is this red thing that is sticking out?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eTakanotsume peppers! I saw that there are some spicy chocolates using peppers on the internet. I feel like I need something as hot as this to express my passion.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003e....What about this green thing?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eThat’s kale. Kale is so high in nutrition that it’s even called a superfood. I put it in so people wouldn’t feel guilty eating just chocolate.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003e....Fufu. It’s nice. I can feel the energy and attentiveness from it. How very like you, Setsuna-chan. I have a suggestion though, may I?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eWhat is it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eI think we can transform this Glorious Chocolate into something more. Maybe into.... an Amazing Chocolate!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eAmazing Chocolate.... That sounds great! Please make it together with me, Kotori-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
