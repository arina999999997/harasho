It’s really good, Umi-chan\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eWhat is so good?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eThe sight of you wearing a Hakama. The fact that you’re holding a bow is also good. As I thought, uniforms shine the most when they are complemented with another item.... Ah, can you turn to your side. I want to take some photos for documentation\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eWhat are you on about. So you don’t have an interest in archery?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eI do! Very much so! It’s a different dignified look from the Hakama that Nozomi-san lent me, and it looks so great! Maaan~, I got to see something so nice. Thank you, Umi-chan\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003e....Would you also listen to my request then?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eIf it’s something I can do, of course!

I’m sure the sight of you pulling a bow would also be beautiful\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eEh? No, that’s not something that I can just do right away....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eI’ll teach you from the beginning.
