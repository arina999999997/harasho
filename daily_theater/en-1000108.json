I wonder….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eHuh, you don’t normally make such a troubled face. What’s the matter?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eYou! Perfect timing♪ What do you think is a good addition for a new version of the Stewshine? The Stewshine needs to evolve further. You’re good at cooking, right You? Help me think of something!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eEh? I don’t know what to say~.... What do you already have in mind?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eCaviar, Foie Gras, Karasumi, and Abalone…. Maybe?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eSo strong! What flavor would that even be!? Well, I don’t know what Caviar or Karasumi taste like though…. How about we change the seasoning instead of changing the base ingredients?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eI see…. If we want to incorporate the flavors then Soy Sauce, Miso, Mirin, Sake, Sesame, and Wasabi…. What else?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eI don’t think you should put Soy Sauce and Miso together…. But, I guess the Japanese style might be a good idea?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eHmm~.... Then, let’s turn it around! How about we soak it in a bran bed?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eEeh!? I thought we’re getting closer to the answer, but how did you even arrive at that conclusion!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
