Looking back at the year by reviewing old lives.... Ruby will do my Rubesty!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eAh, Ruby loves your performance in this one, Shizuku-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThanks. I consulted with you about that outfit, right? The fabric of the ribbon was too delicate for me to handle.... But you helped me out then, didn’t you?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby only helped a little, though.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eNot at all. Thanks to you, I could stick to it until I was satisfied. That’s why the costume looked so good here.... Thank you, Ruby-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eEhehe.... Tell me if there’s anything else Ruby can help with, okay! With that said, even though we were trying to reflect back on our performance this year by reviewing lives, Ruby is now itching to do one.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eMe too! I’m glad you also feel the same, Ruby-san. We can’t really do one right now, but would you practice with me for a bit?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eWaaah, let’s go!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
