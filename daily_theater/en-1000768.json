Here it is, Kanata-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eWaaah, Kanata has never been to this end of the schoolyard before~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eFufu. Nijigaku has not only large buildings but also a vast yard. It’s not often that you get to visit this area unless you’re part of the softball or track team.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eHow did you find this spot, Shioriko-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI needed to check places like these for proper weed treatment. But never mind that, don’t you think this spot has the best environment to take a nap?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eYeah. Kanata was also thinking this was a nice spot~. It’s at the edge of the schoolyard, so it’s very quiet. The trees provide an excellent cover too, but more importantly, the amount of sunlight is just the best~! It’s going to be my new sanctuary~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI’m glad you like it! There’s actually another benefit I would like to point out.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eEh, what is it~?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eBecause it’s at the edge of the schoolyard, you need to dash as fast as you can to get back to the school buildings and club rooms in time. You get both a break and a workout all at once!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eEeeeeeeh!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
