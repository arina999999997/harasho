What’s going on, Kasumi-san?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eWe’re doing a relay-style interview of everyone for the upcoming Shuffle Festival. Ayumu-senpai passed the baton to me. So, Shizuko. How do you feel about the Shuffle Festival?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eTo dive into a completely different world from my own is really fun!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eOoh, you seem really into it, aren’t you?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eFufu. I love to act and express myself, so to see and feel things that I don’t normally experience is both fresh and enjoyable.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eSo basically, we can expect to see a different person than the usual proper Shizuko on the live, right!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eWhat do you mean proper? Are you saying I’m like that?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eDon’t you act like a good girl in front of senpai, Shizuko~. Even though you’re always so harsh on me.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eI-, it’s not like I was trying to act like a good girl! Besides, I’m always kind to you too, Kasumi-san!
