I also love spending time petting this fluffiness♪ Even when I’m depressed, having Shiitake around me is really calming~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eMaaan~, it’s hard to get away from this fluff.... Kanata wonders if we’ll get good dreams if we use Shiitake-chan as a body pillow....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eEeeh, a body pillow?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eYeah. It would be fun if you can sleep and take her on a walk in the dream~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eThat does seem fun, but.... you don’t really need to be in a dream to do that, no?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eDon’t think too much about it~. But you’re right, walking Shiitake-chan sounds like fun~. Kanata wants to try walking along the coast with her.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eThen let’s just go now! You see, even if she looks like this, Shiitake actually pulls you all over the place on walks. It’s a pretty good exercise~.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eEh, is it really that demanding? Can Kanata even keep up.... Maybe it’s better to just stay home and sleep with her....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eIt’s fine, it’s fine! I’m sure you’ll have a good dream if you take a nap after all that walk! With that decided, let’s head out!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
