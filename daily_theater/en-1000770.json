The goat in the video.... The hill Neve-chan was jumping on looked like something out of a movie! It must feel so great to sing there!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eFufu, it does~. I used to always sing there for Neve and the others back in Switzerland.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eAhaha, that sounds fun~! I would love to an overseas live with μ’s! Starting with your hometown’s hill!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eFufu. I think Neve-chan, the others, and my family would be more than happy.

So something like a yellow stage at the end of that maze!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eGoing to μ’s overseas lives sounds like a lot of work....
