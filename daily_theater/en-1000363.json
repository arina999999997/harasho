Shuffle these cards while wishing for what you want to ask\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eOkay....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003e....I got the result. It says, even without saying anything unnecessary, as long as you press forward, it will be a success!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eWaaaah! I’m so glad! Thank you, Nozomi-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eThe cards are so mysterious, huh. They tell us what’s truly important. Hey, Shizuku-chan. What the cards really want to say is “Don’t ask anything unnecessary”\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eEh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eAsking “Is it going to succeed” or “How will it turn out” is unnecessary, you know. The performance is the day you will show the thing you love that you’ve worked hard for every day to everyone. You don’t have to think about anything else. Okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003e....I understand. Thank you so much, Nozomi-san! I have sorted out my unsteady feelings! I want you to watch my next performance, Nozomi-san. Please watch my act!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eFufu, I’m looking forward to it\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
