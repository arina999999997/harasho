Rina-chan’s board「Restless」\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eYou know~, when Kasumin was messaging Shioko earlier, she said that they had a review of mistakes and choreography after yesterday’s live. Are they going to be okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eHmm~, even if Mia-chan has built up quite the stamina.... maybe yesterday was too much for her.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eLanzhu-senpai too. It’s frustrating, but she had a really powerful performance. She said she’s going to show us an even better one today, but no matter how great Lanzhu-senpai is, isn’t she also tired?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003e....While I am worried, I have a feeling that R3BIRTH will be fine.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eWell, if they’re not, then this is the end for them. It just means that they’re not ready to be my rival~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eFufu, we’ll also have R3BIRTH’s celebration party and your birthday party after the live. That’ll be fun.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eEh!? My birthday party!?!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eAh....
