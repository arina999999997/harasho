Is it like this?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYes, you’re doing well. Now, try turning your wrist like this while focusing on your fingertips....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eWaaah, each of your movements is so beautiful, Shioriko-chan. Japanese traditional dance is really hard, huh....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eNo, how you’re able to do it this well for your first time is amazing in its own right. I guess the rest comes with getting used to it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eYeah, there’s no other way than to just practice it over and over again, right? Thank you, Shioriko-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eDon’t mention it, I’m glad if I could be of help. I was really surprised at first when you said you wanted to learn Japanese traditional dance, Riko-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eEhehe, I want my dance for the new song to look graceful down to my fingertips. So I was thinking maybe I could learn something from traditional dance.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eWith that, I’ve also asked Eli-san to teach me ballet next time. I wanted to incorporate everything I can, no matter how little.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI need to learn from your dedication towards your performance, Riko-san. Umm, if you don’t mind, may I also join Eli-san’s ballet class?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eSure, I think she wouldn’t mind. I’ll let her know. Let’s do our best together!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
