It instantly takes away all the sweat from dashing up the stairs.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eYeah, I guess we’re already in that season. Try not to let your body get too cold, You-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eOkay. You too, Dia-san. But man, the view is really nice, isn’t it~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eYou’re right. I could look at it every day and never get tired.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eI think that’s partly because you’re seeing it with someone else.

I’m actually quite hungry too.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eHow rare of you to suggest a detour, Dia-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eLet’s just keep it between us, okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
