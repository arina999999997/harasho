You’re early.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEhehe, I was so excited to hang out with everyone today, so I hurried here. You too, Kanan-san. It’s still 30 minutes away from our meetup time.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThe weather is nice today, so I thought I could lay back and watch the sea of Odaiba. Looks like I came a little bit early.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eAs expected of Kanan-san. You really do love the sea, huh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eOf course I do. The sea and I have an inseparable bond, after all.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003ePlus, The seas of Odaiba and Uchiura are always connected, you know? From place to place, time to time, the sea constantly changes. I want to see all the various views of the sea.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eAll the views of the sea? I guess I’ve never thought about that....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eFufu, then, would you like to watch the sea with me until our meetup time? After all, this particular view of the sea only exists at this moment♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
