Your pajama party is fun, Riko-chan\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eWearing your favorite pajama, talking until late at night while drinking tea and eating sweets.... It’s the best, right! Ah, would you like another cup of tea?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eSure, thank-.... My, your hands are so pretty, Riko-chan. Is it because you play the piano? You have long and slender fingers.... You take good care of them, huh\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eEeh!? I-, is that so? Take good care.... My piano teacher told me to, so it has become a habit of mine. But I don’t think they’re particularly pretty, you know?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eMay I? Hmm, smooth. It’s good that maintaining them has become a habit for you\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eI.... actually have wanted to do nail arts....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eEh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eI always keep my nails short because I play the piano, but sometimes I wish I could do nail arts\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eFufu, that’s my specialty. Nowadays, there are nail art stickers on the market. You can just stick them to your nails. They’re also easy to remove, so I think they’re perfect for you, Riko-chan. Should we go and buy them tomorrow?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eReally!? I’m so happy! Thank you, Karin-san!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
