Let’s just use another cloth after all....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eWe can’t do that!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eWaah!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eAh, s-, sorry. Shizuku-chan, I think a ribbon made from this cloth would fit that outfit the best. It’s light and delicate, and you don’t need any big movements, it can flap around when you walk, so it has to be a ribbon from this one\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eRuby-san....
