You see, Maru finally found a book that Maru has been looking for for so long at a used bookstore~. The library didn’t have it, so Maru had given up. This must be fate zura!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eFate, huh? That sounds kind of cool....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eEh? Did you say something?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eIt’s nothing. Hey, can you take me to that used bookstore? Conveniently finding something you’ve given up on? That sounds like a trap to lure humans in. There’s probably a secret gate hidden in that place. And I, Yohane, shall reveal it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eIt was just luck that Maru found this book zura. Besides, you shouldn’t do anything that’ll cause trouble for the store, okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eI’m not going to! I just want to find magical tomes that are just sitting there, collecting dust, at the corner of the store!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003e....So you want to go look for some books? If that’s what it is, then Maru will take you there zura.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eYaaay! Let’s go look for them together, Zuramaru!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
