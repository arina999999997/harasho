Thank you, Ruby-chan. Kanata will try talking to Haruka-chan one more time when Kanata gets back home!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eFufu, if it’s you and Haruka-chan, you two can surely make up♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
