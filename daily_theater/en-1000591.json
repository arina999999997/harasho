I’m trying to fix a frayed part of my costume right now, but it’s really delicate, so I’m not sure how to do it....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eIf it’s about costumes, why don’t you just ask Kotori about it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eYeah, but Kotori-chan seems busy.

No, please take care of yourself so that you don’t need to get examined by me.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eTo worry about me like that, you really are a good girl, huh, Maki-chan~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eGeez!
