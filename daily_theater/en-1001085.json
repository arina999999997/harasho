It was so exciting that I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading it. The last part of the latest book ends on a good note, so I’m really looking forward to the rest of the story.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI know, right!?

But something was wrong with the atmosphere, and it made me anxious about what will happen next!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eThis work has been serialized for a long time. Setsuna-san, when did you become a fan of it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eActually, I only recently learned about and started liking it.
