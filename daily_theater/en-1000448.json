I was able to perform the script that I made with the help of you and the others with Yoshiko-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eWaah! Is that true!? I wish I could’ve seen that!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eFufu. When I get better, I’m sure Yoshiko-san would also allow us to perform in front of everyone else.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI see. I’ll be looking forward to that day....

What do you think?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eWonderful....! That’s so wonderful, Setsuna-san! I’d love to act that out with Yoshiko-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eLeave it to me. But I’d like to add another character to my vision....
