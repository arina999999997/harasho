I’m sorry, but it’s secondhand from me. But you said you wanted to learn how to conduct yourself in this kind of clothing before. While kimono fall into the same clothing style, hakama also do. And I think hakama often appear as theatrical costumes. So I thought you could get some practice with it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThank you so much, Umi-san! I’m so happy!
