Is there something on your mind?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eAh, Nozomi-san.... It’s nothing serious, but....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eWell, I can read your fortune if you’d like.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEh, would you? Then, please!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eIt says that it’s time to “wait”.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003e“Wait”, huh.... Does that mean it’s better if I don’t move?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eAre you worried about not moving? Then how about you think of it not as “to wait” but as “to rest”? Now is the time to save your strength. There’s that analogy, you know? “You squat low before jumping high”. Just treat it like that!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003e....I guess it’s much nicer to see it from that perspective. I’ll take a break and save my strength!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
