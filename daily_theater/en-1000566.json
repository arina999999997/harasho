But, I guess....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eSetsuna-san? Why do you look so troubled like that? Is there something bothering you?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eShioriko-san. Yeah, it’s something quite serious.... I’ve been thinking about it so much for the past 2 days that I don’t know what to do anymore. It has come to the point where I can’t sleep in my bed at night.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eIt’s really bothering you, huh.... Is there anything I can do to help, Setsuna-san? I know I can’t do much, but I want to be of aid to you.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eShioriko-san....! May I ask for your opinion then....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYes, of course! I’m not sure if I can give anything useful, though....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eShioriko-san.... do you think it’s better to read the last volume of your favorite manga on the release date!?!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003e....The last volume.... of a manga?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eThat’s right. My favorite manga is coming out with its final volume this week. I’ve been careful around social media to avoid any spoilers. I even asked Rina-san, who reads the monthly magazine it’s published in, to not tell me about it yet. That’s how much I’m looking forward to the final volume of this manga! And it’s finally coming out! There’s a part of me that wants to read it right away, but I know once I read it, it will finally come to an end, and that just fills me with this feeling of emptiness.... Aaah, what should I do....!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eUmm.... if you’re agonizing over it so much that you’re losing sleep, it’s probably better if you read it as soon as possible, right....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
