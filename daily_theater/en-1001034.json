It’s so windy today!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eYeah, it got even colder today.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eKarin-san, you don’t look cold! Ah, good thing I wore socks over my tights...... But I look kinda unstylish.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eI have a little secret to not looking cold. Do you want to know, Hanayo-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eHuh, a secret......? S-Sure......!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eThe tights I’m wearing have a higher denier than they look.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEh? They look like what you usually wear......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eThese are fake tights. Try feeling the fabric. You’ll understand what I mean.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003e......Whoa! That’s thick! So, these...... are made to match your skin color to look like your skin is showing through the tights? What......?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eYup. They’re leggings designed to make you not notice the high denier. That way, you can look stylish while staying warm. Do you wanna go shopping for some?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eLet’s go! I want to be stylish and warm, too~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
