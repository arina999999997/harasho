Ruby talked about it with You-chan, but we can’t really decide…. Umm…. It’s this hem right here, can you see it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eYeah, I can see it~. I think it’s fine to leave it like that…. But, maybe it’ll be better if you double stitch it. The strength will be so much different\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eDouble stitch? Won’t that look bad?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eThe frills will hide it so it’s okay. Aqours’ dance are quite intense, so I think it’s better to give it more strength\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby sees, that might be true….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eJust in case, ask You-chan about it too, okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYeah! Thank you, Kotori-san! I’m glad I was able to talk with you!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eFufu, it’s so convenient that we can see and talk to each other even if we’re separated huh\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eBut…. It makes Ruby want to meet you directly….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eP-, please don’t make that face!
