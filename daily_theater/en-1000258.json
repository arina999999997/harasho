A lot of the fish caught in fall are just about to lay their eggs, so they have a lot of fat in them\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eThis is the first time I’ve seen a sashimi boat this big. And it’s full of fish I never ate before. I’m sorry, even though they’re this delicious, I don’t really know the kind of fish they are….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhaha. I guess I’m lucky that you don’t know much about fish, Ayumu-chan! Let me explain them.
