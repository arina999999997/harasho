There’s something I’d like to talk to you about....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eWhat is it? Also, it’s Yohane.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eAh, okay. So you see.... Umm,  Yoshi-.... Yohane-san, it’s about A・ZU・NA. Are they giving you any trouble?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eEh!? H-, how do you.... No, it’s nothing. They’re not really troubling me or anything. They’re my little demons, after all.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI see. That’s good then. The other day, I inadvertently saw Ayumu-san and the others simulating how they would defend you, Yohane-san, if an army of angels came to attack....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eHuh!? N-, no, never mind.... Kuukuku! I see they’re looking down on me!! Yohane doesn’t need my little demons to protect me. I’m going to beat up the army of angels with my magical powers alone!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eAh, you’re roleplaying....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eIt’s not roleplay!!!! Listen, Shioriko.... This is only between us, but I’m sure there are those who are after my magic.... But that’s my problem. I don’t want other people to do anything dangerous. Shioriko.... you get what I’m saying, right? Will you be my ally and protect them?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eAyumu-san and the others are in danger!? I can’t let that slide. I may not be of much use, but allow me to help, Yohane-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eYes, good girl. Then from now, you need to listen to what I’m saying!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
