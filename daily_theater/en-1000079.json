You came all the way here to give it to me!? I was gonna get it myself though~! Sorry, it must’ve been heavy right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eNope! It’s one of Maru’s beloved books, so it’s not heavy at all. More importantly, is the one Maru picked fine?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eIf you picked it, then there’s no doubt about it, Hanamaru-chan~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eUmm, this book is set in a medieval castle zura. Maru was able to imagine many things from reading this book. A pure white castle perched on a cliff overlooking a lake…. At the top of the tower is a princess with amber hair and sapphire eyes….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003e….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eAh, sorry!
