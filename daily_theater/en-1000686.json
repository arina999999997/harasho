Kanan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eYeah~. All the time we spent thinking about it paid off.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eWe were even able to put plenty of each other’s favorites into it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eYeap. Oceans are a fundamental part of a triathlon, but to put in mountain activities as well? You’re a genius, Umi-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eIt’s because I’ve always found it difficult to prepare enough bicycles for everyone every time.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eYou’re right. This way we don’t even need to prepare them. Maaan~, mountains are amazing. I take back everything I said!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eThe ocean is quite incredible too.

I don’t know why everyone calls it the “Hell Triathlon”.... But the word “hell” would intimidate people.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eHmm~, then.... how about the “Triathlon to Heaven”!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
