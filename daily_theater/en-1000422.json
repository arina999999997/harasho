If you can't even solve something as easy as this, you won't be able to clear the escape room!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThis one is pretty hard, you know? Do you really know the answer?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eOf course I do!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThen write it down. Right here. The answer.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003e....T-, then it wouldn't be good practice for you, Kanan. Solve it by yourself.

Nico can't solve it either.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAs long as you're honest! Alright, let's work together to solve it. If there are two of us, we'll be done in no time!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
