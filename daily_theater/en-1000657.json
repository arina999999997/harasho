Fufufu, it was nothing. Ruby-chan said she wanted to make some nutritious sandwiches for you as refreshments because you seem tired. But I only taught her how to wrap them properly so that the contents won’t spill when you eat them.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eFufu, Ruby was very grateful, and so am I. Thank you for doing it for Ruby and, to an extent, for me.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eI-, it’s really nothing much....
