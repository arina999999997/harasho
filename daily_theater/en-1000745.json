Looks like you can give treats to the cats here.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eReally? I’d like to try it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eAh, Maki-san, there’s an orange tabby next to you....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eEh? Umm, wait.... What should I do? It fell asleep on my lap.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eFufu. It seems to really like your lap, Maki-san. How about we give the snacks a bit later? Let’s let it sleep in peace.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eThere’s a calico one and a white one on your side, Shioriko.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eEh....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003e....Fufu, they will also feel tense if you freeze up like that. Why don’t you play with them with this catnip?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI-, I’ll try. I played with Hanpen back in Nijigaku, so I’ve got plenty of practice.... There, there, come on, over here~. Huh? The calico one has been tapping at my hand instead of the catnip....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003e....What a smart one. We can’t let them beat us, Shioriko!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
