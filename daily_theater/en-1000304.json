I can understand why someone would have so much fun on school idol activities that they work too hard. But I also understand why you would be worried, Eli-san\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eThank you. But I also don’t want to disregard their efforts\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eYou’re amazing, Eli-san. If it were me, I think I would simply say “You shouldn’t work too hard”....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eIs there any good way, I wonder?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eTo not disregard their efforts, huh....
