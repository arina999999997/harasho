What a coincidence\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eDo you have a magazine modeling work around here? I’d love to watch you model, Karin-san\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eUmm, that’s not why I’m here. There is a specialty store that I’m interested in, so I was going there. But it seems to be at a slightly confusing place....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eEeeh! A specialty store, how stylish! Can I go with you?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eYes, of course! Then, do you know this place?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eHmm.... Huh?
