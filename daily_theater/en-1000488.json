Thanks for lending it to me.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eAh, you finished it? How was it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eIt was really good! There are so many different uniforms on it that Ruby wants to reference for our next outfit.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eRight!? I knew you would understand, Ruby-chan~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYeah. Ruby was especially interested in the one on this page.... this one!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eThe flight attendant uniform, huh! I’ve also always wanted to imitate the scarf and the hat.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eThat’s right, it would be cute if everyone had a different color scarf, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eYeah, and we can wrap the scarf slightly differently for the 9 of us too.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eWaaah, that would definitely be cute!
