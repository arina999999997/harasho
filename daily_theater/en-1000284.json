I’m kind of bad at it....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eIn my case, I run while listening to the soundtracks of anime I like. When I hear the soundtrack, my favorite scenes come to mind, and before I know it, I’m sprinting with all my might.... Maybe it’s more that I can’t control my urges.... Don’t you have something like that?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eHmm.... For me, when I listen to a song of a school idol I like, I get all restless\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eThat’s it! You should also run while listening to songs you like, Hanayo-san. You can channel that restlessness into leg power!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eI-, I see!
