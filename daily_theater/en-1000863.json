I wish we could practice outside for once.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eWell, it’s the rainy season, so we have to be patient for a bit.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eThe rainy season?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eHave you never heard of it, Mia-chan? The rainy season is when it rains a lot. It happens because, umm.... Something with cold and warm air....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eWhat?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eUeeeh.... Ruby should’ve studied more.... Ah, it’s probably on the internet! Let’s see.... Look, here. This is how it works.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eHmm.... So that’s why. I wonder if it’s like the squalls we have in New York? So, it’s going to be like this for quite some time, huh....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eIt does clear up once in a while. Days like that feel so nice~. Plants and flowers seem alive and look sparkling green because of the rain. Hydrangeas also look really pretty. Ruby will show you them when it’s sunny!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eReally!? I’ll look forward to that.... In the meantime, let’s do our best practicing even when it rains!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYeah! Let’s do our dance practice together!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
