But why?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAi would like to try making an igloo. If it does snow at your place, then Ai was thinking of making one there, Chikacchi\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eAh, an igloo! I want to try making one too\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eLast time there was a big snowfall in Tokyo, Ai made one together with everyone in the shopping district. It was a lot of fun\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eThat sounds awesome! Did you eat mochi in the igloos?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAi didn’t get to eat mochi, but Ai did drink hot lemonade. It tasted better than usual~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eThat’s nice. I want to try eating mikan in an igloo too! Do you know? Mikan also tastes delicious when roasted! It’s called roasted mikan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eEh, for real!? Ai can’t really imagine it....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0101/\u003eIt may be hard to make the igloos, but we can make roasted mikan anytime! Let’s do it right now~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
