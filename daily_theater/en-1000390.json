I wasn’t sure if I could do it on my own.... You were a huge help.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eDon’t mind it. I got to see AZALEA’s live outfit early, so I benefit more from this. But it was a nice decision for you to strengthen these outfits. It really should be done. Considering these will be used in AZALEA dances.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eI usually consult with Ruby or You-san about it, but this time I want the two of them to just look forward to the live.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eFufu, I understand that feeling. You want to surprise them even more, right. I’m happy that you asked me about the costumes. I thought maybe people would rely on me after all....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eI am relying on you!

Honey lemon?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eSpot on. Maybe we can make lemonade with these? I’d love to hear more details about the upcoming live while we drink.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eMy. I would like to know more about Nijigaku too.
