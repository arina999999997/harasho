That was hard, Kanan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eNo no no, people who really think that it’s hard can’t cool down that fast.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eThis plan really pushes you, though, so if you don’t cool down properly, you’ll have a bad time later.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eWell, that’s true. I’ll help you stretch your body. Give me your hands.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eThank you. Hnnn~~~, that feels good! But man, you guys really made a brutal training plan, Kanan. So this is the hell triathlon, huh~. Ai totally gets why Kasukasu was crying now.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eShe was? Well, I guess I did something terrible to her.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eNo, no, she was crying, but she was proud that she did it. You know, does everyone in Aqours do these kinds of amazing stuff all the time? Well, Ai thought that you guys must have done a ton of practice from watching your dances, but....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eWe do, but it’s not like it’s easy for all of us either. Yoshiko-chan has been complaining a lot recently during the triathlon.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAi thinks it’s actually amazing how she can complain while doing this, though....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eHuh? Ah, I see.... Maybe I should raise the level for Aqours a little bit more!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
