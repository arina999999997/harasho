But well, if we start changing things now, it would take too much time....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eMari agrees with Kanan. Besides, wouldn’t it be more interesting to have “something” that would surprise our fans?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eWell, that might be true, but....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eWith that said, Mari has an idea! How about we fly some hot-air balloons and use them for our live? Doesn’t that sound fun?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eHot-air balloons!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eHot-air balloons!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eThat’s right! We’ll ride on the balloons to the sky and perform from there! Ah, our fans would also ride on them, and we’ll all have a live in the sky. Interesting, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhaha, as expected of Mari! The scale of your “something” is really big, huh~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eThat’s too dangerous! Plus, there’s no way we could prepare that many hot-air balloons....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eIt’s fine! Leave it to me♪ Mari will go get us some balloons now!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eEh, Mari, you’re being serious!? W-, wait, hold on-!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
