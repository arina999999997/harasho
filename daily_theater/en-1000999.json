I like it too, but I’m not sure if it would be suitable for a cold day since it doesn’t have a thick lining......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eIt’s made of compressed wool, so I think it should be fine. There are a lot of coats made with that fabric lately.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eCompressed wool... Judging by the name, the fabric is dense, so it’ll be difficult for the wind to come through?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eYeah, something like that. If it’s freezing, you can put this on...... Here, a scarf. You’ll be fine even in the dead of winter!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eOh, right! Thanks, Kotori-san, you’re very knowledgeable. Then, I’ll go with this one......!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eThis winter, let’s hang out a lot together while you wear that coat!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eOf course! Okay, now to pick out a coat that would look good on you, Kotori-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eFufu, I wonder what you have in store for me, Shioriko-chan~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eThere are so many items I want you to try on!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
