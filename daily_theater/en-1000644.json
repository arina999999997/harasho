All the first-years have been doing it together. It’s just as you said before, Riko-san. Everyone complains about how cold it is throughout the session. But even though it’s hard, it’s a lot of fun, and time really flies by!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eFufu, I told you.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eRiko-san, may I ask you some other questions? I want to know more about the secrets of Aqours’ fitness!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eHmm.... I guess one would be to have a strict member prepare the training plan....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eHave a strict member prepare the training plan, you say?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eThe plans that Dia-san and Kanan-chan came up with are something else. But the more demanding it is, the more it pays off. By the way, I heard that they came up with a new version of Kanan’s “Hell Triathlon”.... We haven’t tried it yet, but it looks like Karin-san helped out on this one, you know?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eEeeh!? Even Karin-san is involved? I wonder if I can keep up....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eAhaha.... To be honest, I’m quite worried too.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThen I’m going to do my best and continue the beach training plan! So that may be able to challenge new things!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
