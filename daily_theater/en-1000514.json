She probably got influenced by the movie we saw the other day....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eAhaha, Kaoruko-san really is an interesting person, huh.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eThat’s what everyone says, but from my perspective, she’s just problematic....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eSo, did you go to the museum after all?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYeah, we went there.

That’s.... well.... I suppose so.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eFufu, hearing your story makes me want to go out with Onee-chan too, Shioriko-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby also wants to go to the museum with Onee-chan. Maybe Ruby will go ask Onee-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
