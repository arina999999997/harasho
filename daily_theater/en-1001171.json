I’d like to experience that too.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eDon’t you kinda live like you’re in a dorm too? I mean, you can talk to Chika on the balcony, right? That’s what she told me.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eYeah, that’s true. Chika-chan is my next-door neighbor, and our rooms are right next to each other.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eI’m so jealous of that too! We can’t talk on the balcony in the dorms.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eIs that so?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eYes! When I’m about to sleep and suddenly have an idea for a live performance, I want someone to hear me out right away. You can do that with Chika, can’t you?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eHmm... I guess it’s easier to discuss things like that. Though we do send messages to each other before we go outside to talk.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eBeing neighbors is just as great as dorm life, huh! How awesome!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
