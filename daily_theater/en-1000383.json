This shape will be hard to make with a cloth. If we want to keep the shape like this, then maybe we can use plastic boards....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI see.... It’s hard to make this uniform’s shape in real life, huh. I thought this uniform looked really cool in the anime, so I would like to incorporate some of its elements into my next outfit, but....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eI understand how you feel! This uniform looks really good.... I really think so. I also like it\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eRight!? Waah, it seems like we have the same taste.

T-, then, I’d like to think some more about the design, can we think about it together....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eLeave it to me!
