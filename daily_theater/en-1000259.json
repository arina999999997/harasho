But, you like complicated stories too, huh, Setsuna-chan. To be honest, I didn’t quite get it on the time paradox part.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eAh, I don’t fully understand that part of the story either. But the relationship between people is interesting without needing the logical stuff. The sometimes hot sometimes painful swaying emotions of the girl…. That’s where I get fired up!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eI see. Certainly, I was touched by the friendship of those girls too\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eFufu, I’m glad that Emma-san understands how good it is.

Because seeing your face when you talk about the things you love is also something that I love\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eI’m glad~. Then, listen to my story!
