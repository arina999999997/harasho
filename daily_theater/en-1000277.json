Haa....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eAaaand, I think that’s about it? .... Wawaa! Are you okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI-, I’m sorry. I’m okay\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eHere, drink some water. I’m so sorry, I took you all over the place, didn’t I\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eIt’s fine, now I understand just what a lovely place Uchiura is. Thank you for showing me around, You-san\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eBy the way, every place we went to so far has also been visited by other Nijigaku members. Until now, you don’t really get it when we talk about Uchiura, right, Shioriko-chan? But with this, you’ll get everything♪ Look, I bought some souvenirs for you!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYou did this just for me....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eWell~, if I have to choose, then it’s probably out of my own desire. I thought it’ll be more fun if everyone has the same image pop up in their head when we’re talking about something~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eFrom now on, I too can have the same scenery pop up in my head if I remember today. Thank you so much, You-san.... I’m glad\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eEhehe, if you say that then I guess I’m glad too! You have some time before you go home, right? Want to go to the beach? Actually, I thought that I want to eat something together if we still have time, so I bought some mikan dorayaki!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
