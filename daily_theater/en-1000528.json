It’s a scene between a young girl aiming to be a dancer and an older girl who is a professional dancer. Alright, I’ll start, okay.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003e“Onee-sama, how can I dance as perfectly as you do?”\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003e“Dancing is all about passion. If you don’t put your feelings into your dance, they won’t reach your partner either.”\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003e“But, how should I....”\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003e“Isn’t it obvious, feel as you dance.
