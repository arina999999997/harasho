Kanata?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eNnah, sorry. It seems like Kanata dozed off there....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eFufu, it was so much fun talking that it turned night already, huh. It’s a given you’ll get sleepy. Hey, Mari will count animals for you, Kanata♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eReally? Kanata will probably fall asleep at the third one, but Kanata still wants you to count them~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eThen I’ll start, okay. One crocodile with a frog on its head....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eCrocodile?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eAh, I thought that I should mix the continuation of my story earlier with counting the animals♪ Remember, it’s the time when Mari first went to play in Florida~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eSo there are crocodiles in Florida. Sounds scary~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eThere are usually small ones on the waterway by the side of the road. That’s why I often see them from the car. Alright, that’s enough of that, so close your eyes now.... Two crocodiles with a bird perched on his head, three normal crocodiles, a big fight between a bird that’s going after a frog and a crocodile that’s going after the bird~....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eWait\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eEh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eKanata is too curious about that story, so Kanata is wide awake now. It sounds really interesting, so let me hear it normally!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eOf course! The part after this is also exciting~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
