This is the beach where Aqours members often come to practice in\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eI thought the sea in winter was supposed to be more dull, but that’s not true at all, huh. It’s the same color as the sky and really pretty!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eIsn’t it? My image of the sea really changed ever since I moved here. It’s so different from the seas of Tokyo\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eFufu, looks like you found something wonderful here, Riko-chan\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eYou move houses a lot too, right, Nozomi-san?
