This Yohane appears here, after all!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eLet’s see.... Taking your character into consideration, it might just work, Yoshiko-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eHmm, then let’s change the lighting. And maybe add smoke and other stuff! What do you think, Yoshiko-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eYou two.... It’s Yohane, okay!? Also, it’s not a character! ....Ahem, putting that aside, adding smoke is a good idea. We can have me come out from it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eHow about we also scatter some black feathers from the top? They were selling them in bulk at a store I went to the other day.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eOooh! That sounds interesting! It would be okay, right, Yoshiko-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eAs I said, it’s Yohane! The black feather is a good idea too. Let’s go buy them!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eAh, umm, there’s also a taiyaki place near that store. So if you want to, we could....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eEeeh, really!? Let’s go, let’s go! I wonder if they’ll have cream cheese taiyaki~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eI’ll get a chocolate one! What about you, Shioriko?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI-, I’ll go with red bean paste! Fufu, I’m looking forward to shopping even more now!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
