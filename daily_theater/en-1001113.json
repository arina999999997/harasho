I bought these on a shopping trip with Ayumu-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eFufu, it’s nice to see that you chose a knit top with exposed shoulders, Shioriko-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI thought I’d catch a cold wearing a knit top that exposes my shoulders... But I remembered you and Ai-san explained how to cover up when necessary, so I tried to do that. When I’m outside, I wear a coat and a shawl. When I’m indoors where it’s warm, I’m fine, so it’s just a matter of adjusting for the temperature outside!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eThat’s great. Fashion takes planning 𝅘𝅥𝅮\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eUm, I know that knee-high boots look good with shorts. And Ai-san said that it’d also protect you from the cold, but my thighs are cold. What should I do......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eDo you still feel cold even if you wear tights?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eA bit......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eEndure it then, if it’s just a bit!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eAlright. Fashion takes planning and a bit of endurance. I get it now!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
