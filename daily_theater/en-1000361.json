I’m glad I could tell you in person today!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eEeeh!? Thank you, but compared to you, Setsuna-san, Ruby is still nothing.... Ruby somehow managed to do it only because Ruby did it together with everyone...\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eHmm.... It didn’t seem like that to me, but if that’s what you say, Ruby-san, then maybe you’re right....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby doesn’t think it was good enough.... Eh, aaah, even though you’re complimenting me, sorry!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYou don’t have to apologize! I know how it feels to not be able to compromise on the things you love!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby is happy for your compliments, Setsuna-san. Ruby will work harder to be more confident!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYou’re welcome! Umm, I probably shouldn’t say this after you said you weren’t satisfied with your own performance, but during the live, your face says that you were really enjoying it and 100% satisfied with it. When I see that, I gradually had more fun too\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003e....Ah, that’s true! You’re right! Ruby definitely enjoyed it 100%! Things can be frustrating at times, but lives are always so much fun!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI’m glad! I was able to take in that feeling properly, huh!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby wonders if everyone else who watched it also had fun? Ruby wants to ask them right now!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
