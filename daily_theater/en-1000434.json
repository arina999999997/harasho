What is it like to have a childhood friend?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEh? What is it, all of a sudden....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eAh, sorry. I just read a book about two childhood friends, and I thought it must be really nice. That’s why I wanted to ask someone who actually has a childhood friend.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eFufufu, so that’s what it is. Let’s see.... It’s like having your album of memories be doubled in size, I guess?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eAlbum of memories?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eYeah. They’re someone who remembers things that you don’t even remember yourself.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eWaah.... That sounds lovely!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEhehe.... But they remember embarrassing things too~. That might be a little.... inconvenient, maybe?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eFufu. That’s an enviable part too. It must be so nice....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEven if you aren’t friends with them from when you’re little, don’t you also have countless stuff in your album of memories right now, Riko-chan? I remember my memories with you, and everyone in Aqours surely remembers even more. Let’s keep increasing the count in our albums from now on, okay!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
