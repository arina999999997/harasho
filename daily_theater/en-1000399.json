This was umm.... something that Ayumu-san lent me but ended up being my possession.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eIs that so?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYes, back when I just entered the club, I forgot to bring a towel. She lent it to me then, but when I tried to give it back after washing it, she told me to “Keep it.”\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eFufu, it’s been your favorite since back then, huh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eEh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYou have such a big smile on your face right now, Shioriko-san.

Of course we can, or rather, I would love to have something matching like that. You know, as proof of our unity as fellow first-graders! Why don’t we ask Kasumi-san and Rina-san about it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eLet’s! I’ll go get both of them!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
