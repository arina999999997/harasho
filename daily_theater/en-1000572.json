Are you insane!? We’ve already done enough.... Any more and this delicate body of mine wouldn’t be able to get up, what would you do then!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eWe need to push ourselves sometimes. These next 30 reps will help limber up our bodies.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eNo, no way, impossible! Nico will just count your reps for you, Eli. Nico will pay attention to my own safety today and end-\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eMy, are you giving up, Nico-chan? Then I guess Eli and I are going to be one level above you, huh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eHaaaah~~!?!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eYou know I’m right.

Like I would ever give up!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eLeave it there, both of you....!
