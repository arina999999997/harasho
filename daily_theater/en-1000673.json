You’re not gonna say that you’re doing a birthday party for me, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEh? Well, that was the plan.... We looked up how birthday parties are in America, and then....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eI’m thankful, but I’m not a kid anymore. I don’t need anything fancy.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eI-, I see.... We saw that they do massive birthday parties in America, so Setsuna-chan, Lanzhu-chan, and Mari-san were going to do a hero show. Shioriko-chan and Umi-chan were going to do a traditional Japanese dance with a rock arrangement. And Kanata-san and Kotori-chan were making a cupcake tower.... I guess it ended up being too much. I’m sorry.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eLet’s go right now.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eReally? I’m glad!
