And it’s Yohane.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eI’m really looking forward to our sweets tour today! I want to try a buckwheat flour crepe!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eThat’s not what I mean! Don’t you have anything to say about this Yohane look?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003e...?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eCould it be... this outfit doesn’t suit me...?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eWha!? That’s not true at all! It looks great on you! The big frilly lace on the sleeves is light and cute, and the big ribbon at your waist is also cute, but it doesn’t look too cutesy since it’s made from a shiny, stiff material. Your brooch also looks lovely!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eReally?! I put a lot of thought into it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eWait, Yoshiko... Yohane-chan, did you remember what I said before? That you should wear what suits you. That’s what I said, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eWell, not exactly, but... I mean, I didn’t forget everything. It was just in the back of my mind...\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eHehe, I’m so happy!! Hey, after we eat, let’s go shopping! I want to help you pick out some early summer clothes! Let’s goooo~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eHey, wait up, Kotori!
