The mermaid style one piece is usually very mature, but it also has this cuteness thanks to the floral pattern.... It’s perfect for you, Eli-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eThank you. Hearing you say that gives me confidence, Ruby.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYeah, Ruby thinks it’s really nice. This material is breezy and perfect for summer. It helps bring out more of your cool charms, Eli-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eGeez, if you keep praising me that much, I’m going to be embarrassed.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eBut you do look beautiful!

Ruby does love fashion, but.... Ruby just felt that Ruby wants to see you in this one, or something like that.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eThat “I want to see you in this” feeling is probably a sign that you’re developing your fashion sense. Wouldn’t you say so, Ruby? Besides, it is thanks to you that I got to find this beautiful one piece, so you don’t have to be so modest, okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003e....Okay!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
