She kept saying that she wanted to talk to you, Mia-san, so I think she got too excited.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eIt’s not like this will be the last time. She can talk to me whenever, you know?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eThank you very much. I’m sure Ruby will be happy to hear that.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003e....Are you always helping Ruby out like this, Dia?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eEh? No, I’m not. There are many times that Ruby has helped me out too. You also have an older sister, right, Mia-san? I’m sure you understand.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003e....I guess, but I don’t see her often. She probably already forgot about me.

I get it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003e....*Gasp*! Mia-san, did you say that just now because you were homesick....? That’s not good. Please, come to our house. Ruby and I will help you forget about your homesickness. Come on, we’re going!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eW-, wait! I’m not homesick!
