We will discuss our next live performance… but before that, we have to talk about Yosh-... Yohane-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eI wanted to talk about her too. I think that we’re the only ones who know her secret, so...\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eAre you two... actually serious?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eOf course we are!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eYeah. Yohane-chan says that she can defeat the angels with her magic, but I’m sure that she would be nervous about fighting alone.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYou really believe this...? Never mind, if you two have decided to trust in her, then I will follow you to the bitter end. Let’s protect Yohane-san from the angels!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYeah!

To be honest, I’m a little interested.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eWouldn’t it be dangerous for people who are unfamiliar with it to wield this power?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThen we must become stronger. Let’s discover what training we must undergo to be strong enough to control this power!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eLet’s go ask Yohane-san~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
