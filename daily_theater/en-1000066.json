What’s up all of a sudden?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eLearning ballet makes you feel like you’re from the big cities, so I kind of long for it. And Maru is also at that age where I want to grow a little bit taller\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eI-, is that so….?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003ePlus, it would also be helpful in Aqours performances. I want to teach Ruby-chan and Yoshiko-chan too so we can surprise Chika-chan and the others♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eI see…. That’s your real goal right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eEh, umm…. That’s not…. entirely untrue zura…\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eFufu. You can’t really lie huh, Hanamaru? I can teach you ballet, but if I’m the only one teaching you it doesn’t feel fair. So Hanamaru, could you teach me something too?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eWhat Maru can teach Eli-san…. Uhh, hmm…. Ah, that’s right! Umm, this is a top secret information that I know but….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eOkay\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eActually, Maru knows a place where you can make your own original tendon! You buy rice at the counter, then you pick the tempura, after that you put anything else you like and complete the tendon! Ah, I kind of want to eat it now…. Eli-san, let’s go!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eEh!? What about the ballet lesson!? Hanamaru…. Hanamaru, wait-!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
