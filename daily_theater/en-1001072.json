What did you do during your time there?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eThere were a lot of people swimming on the beach or going shopping, but I think I spent most of my time doing nothing.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eHuh, you were doing nothing?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eYes!
