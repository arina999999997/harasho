Can I do something to help?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eWould you, Emmacchi? You see, my local shopping district is doing a summer festival~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eA summer festival!? I want to help!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eThanks! So, Ai was having a hard time figuring out what monja we should serve at our stall. Do you have any good ideas?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eAn orthodox monja would be the best, but....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAbsolutely, Emmacchi~♪ But we need some exciting menu to catch the attention of all the kids who don’t eat monja all that much.
