Maru thought she’d drop all of the books she borrowed.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eThat’s a lot of books.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eEhehe. Maru gathered all of the books that she wanted to read this autumn.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eAutumn books......? That’s a thing?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eMaru thought it’d be a good idea.

That sounds different from what you usually read.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003ePure literature is always great to read, zura!
