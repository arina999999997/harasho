I found this when I was cleaning the storage room! Brings back memories, doesn’t it~?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eIs that.... an album?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eYup. Look, remember this one?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003e! We had a picture of this!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eUfufu, it really takes you back, right~?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eYeah. Kanan-san caught a small tree frog....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eAnd both of us made a big fuss about it~. You almost cried back then, Dia.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eY-, you almost did too, Mari-san! I vividly remember it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eBut Kanan kept saying how cute it was, so we slowly opened up to it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eAnd finally, the three of us released the frog on a lush green field. Fufu, how nostalgic. Since we found it, why don’t we call Kanan-san over to look at this album with us?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
