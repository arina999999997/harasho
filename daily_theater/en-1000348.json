Was there any part that’s hard to understand?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eNo, I just want you to confirm if I can do it properly or not\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eProperly, huh.... Aren’t yours always perfect, Umi\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eI have confidence in my ability to remember the choreography, but.... When I saw the last live’s video, I thought I can’t keep going on like this\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eI see. So, in other words, you’re bothered by the progress of the other girls?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003e! That’s right! Rin has started to get the fine movements right, Kotori’s expressions have also softened during her performance. Maki and Hanayo have also steadily improved....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eFrom my perspective, I think you’ve also improved enough, Umi. You’re no longer shy about doing poses anymore, and above all, you’re having fun\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eEeh!? I-, is that so....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eOf course! But it’s wonderful to have a desire to keep improving yourself. I’ll take a look at parts that have been bothering you. But in return, you’ll have to accompany me with practice, okay\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
