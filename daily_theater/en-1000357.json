The winter sea breeze is cold, isn’t it\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYes, it was cold and intense, running became really hard.... Ophelia was with me, but I felt like giving up. That’s why I really admire you and the others for always training like that, Riko-san\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eFufu. Even we do it while complaining that it’s hard\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eReally!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eTotally~! Fufu. But, when we do it while crying out that it’s painful or cold like that, it became fun before we knew it. Didn’t that happen to you?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYou’re right.... It might have been like that\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eThat’s why, if you invite the rest of Nijigaku and do it together, it might also become fun, you know, Shizuku-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eI understand! I think I’ll try inviting Kasumi-san and the others!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eThat’s the spirit!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
