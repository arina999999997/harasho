Ai heard from Rinari!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eIt’s not Yoshiko, it’s Yohane. Yeah, I do live streams. For the little demons who wish to hear the words of Yohane, it’s as addictive as the sweetest honey. I suppose it’s an oasis to those little demons who seek to immerse themselves in the world of Yohane.... Kukuku\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eCan Ai be on your stream?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eHey! Are you even listening to me!? The world of Yohane and you aren’t a good match (Aishou), you know!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eEven though my name is Ai~?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eDon’t make a pun! See, that kind of atmosphere doesn’t fit well with the image of my streams! But if you really want to be on it.... Then you should also become a little demon!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eSure, Ai can be one. What should Ai do? Do we need bats or something?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eDon’t do anything weird! You only need to be captivated by this Yohane. Lose yourself in my overflowing magical power....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAah, then Ai might be able to do that. Ai can’t take my eyes off of Aqours’ lives after all! You have a special kind of charm when you’re performing, you know, Yoshiko~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eEh.... That’s not-! Argh! Fine! You can be on my stream!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
