We sure have accumulated a lot of stuff in this room...... Phew.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eThis was originally only Nico-chan’s stuff, but ever since we joined, there’s so much more stuff.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eAh, this...... Maki, Maki!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eWhat is it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eHere, take a look at this.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003e......What kind of picture is this? What a weird angle.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eThis was most likely taken by Nico while she was spying on us when we first started practicing at the shrine. She usually hid in this spot.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eNico-chan wouldn’t like it if she found this picture, but she also didn’t get rid of it......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eNico must have saved it for a reason. Let’s hide it again.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
