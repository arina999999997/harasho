Racing around in animal cars is so cute, right? But Ruby is worried if Ruby could talk while playing or not.... So Ruby wants to learn from you, Rina-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eYoshiko-chan also livestream games. Why didn’t you ask her instead?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eThe games that Yoshiko-chan likes are of a different genre from what Ruby wants to play, so....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eI see.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYou play lots of different games, right, Rina-chan? You said that you played a cute mobile game with Ayumu-san, so Ruby thought you might be good at this sort of game too. Please teach me!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eOf course, leave it to me. Rina-chan’s board「Determined」\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eEhehe, thank you~! Then, which car do you want, Rina-chan? Ruby will go with~.... maybe this hamster car. Because it’s cute with its flower ribbon.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eI will.... go with this rabbit one. It has a rocket booster.... it seems fast. But first, unless you get used to the game itself, it’ll be hard to talk.... so let’s play a lot. I’ll start.... okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYeah!
