The μ’s and Aqours joint live was the beginning for me, so it’s somewhat like.... a dream come true\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eμ’s and Aqours both really put their all on that joint live, right. Even now, when I play the video back, I think that they were really amazing\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eUmm.... You were amazing too, you know, Hanayo-chan? You were also sparkling on that stage, and the thrill reached that person and me, you know?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eT-, that’s....

When we receive compliments, it should be better if we say “Thank you” instead. Thank you for the compliment, Hanayo-chan\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eMe too!
