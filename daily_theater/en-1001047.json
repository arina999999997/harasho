What was it about?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eSo on Christmas day, a young boy gets left home alone, and a couple of burglars enter his house...\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eSounds like a pretty grim movie.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eNo, not at all~!
