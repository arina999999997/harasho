Do you want to have another one?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eThe sleepover with the four of us was a lot of fun. So this time.... I want to have one with all the first-years from μ’s and Aqours too.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThat sounds like fun! There are things we can only talk about with other first-years, so I’d love to have one too! Let’s try inviting them.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eHow should we invite them? Just send a message....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThat’s fine, but since we’re doing one, how about we make invitations and send them out to everyone? It would be like a secret invitation letter!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eA secret invitation letter.... That seems interesting! Rina-chan’s board「Sparkly Eyes」\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eMaybe we could also make it in a cipher or something similar....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eA cipher.... that would be so cool! There is software that can make ciphers too.... So I’m sure I can make one that would be hard to break. Leave the cipher to me! Rina-chan’s board「Determined」\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eW-, wait! If you go all out on making the cipher, none of us would be able to solve it, Rina-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
