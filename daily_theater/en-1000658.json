I didn’t know being surrounded by the ocean could feel this good! Thank you for letting me ride on your boat, Kanan-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eIt’s nothing~. But again, is this really how you want me to thank you for accompanying me on the trail run?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eIt’s not nothing! This is really amazing! I’m from Switzerland, right? Switzerland doesn’t have an ocean. That’s why I’ve always wanted to be in a place like this where it’s just the open sea everywhere you look.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhahaha, I guess it would be very unusual for you. Ah, that’s right, use this. This time of the year is quite cold, isn’t it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eWaaah, the blanket is so warm~. With this, I really want to watch the ocean forever.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eYeah. It’s the same view as far as the eye can see, but somehow I never get tired of it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eDoesn’t it just look so but not exactly the same? It’s like how on idol lives, even if they sing the same song every time, you’ll find a different charm to them, you know? The ocean is probably also like that.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eYou might be right! Even if people sing the same song, there will always be a difference, huh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eI guess the ocean has the same charm point as school idols~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eFufu, looks like I found yet another reason to love the sea.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
