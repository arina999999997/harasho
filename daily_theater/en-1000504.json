The melodies aren’t coming to me at all....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eMe too. I can’t think of how to write the lyrics for the new song....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eWell, this is a problem, isn’t it. Even though there’s barely any time left before the next live....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eWe said that we’re going to write a song while everyone else practices today, so we can’t really back out now, can we.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eYeah, let’s think about it some more. We’ll have to somehow get at least a rough idea of the song by the end of today....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eYou’re right....

I think I’m feeling some vanilla today~”.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eAhaha! Geez, that caught me off guard. Maybe we’ve been focusing on this too much.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eFufu, that’s right. Let’s have some ice cream to refresh ourselves.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
