It seems your relationship with people close to you may change soon. The key is for you to be proactive, Shioriko-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003ePeople close to me.... Would that be my sister....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eYou can think of it as anyone you've had a long relationship with.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eLanzhu! It might be Lanzhu!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eIt might. You two are childhood friends, after all.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eIf I'm proactive, I may change our relationship.... That means I should take the initiative from now on, right? I've always been passive when dealing with my sister and Lanzhu, so I often get pushed around by them. This might be my chance to change that....!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eI'm glad you're taking my fortune-telling seriously, but don't get swept up by it, alright? Just think of it as a hint and be yourself!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eY-, you're right. I'm sorry. My sister asked me to go touring with her on a bike, and Lanzhu invited me for some winter swimming, both of which are a bit much for me.... I was hoping I could suggest a different activity instead....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eOh.... Well, maybe you should do that....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
