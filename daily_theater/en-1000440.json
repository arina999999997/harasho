Even though Nico came here to celebrate with you! That reaction is putting it way too lightly, you know!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eWaaah! I’m so thrilled that you’re here to celebrate my birthday, Nico-san~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eThat acting is too dramatic and creepy.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eIsn’t creepy a bit too harsh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eWell, it’s fine. Before we go to the others, there’s something I’d like to say. I think you’re amazing, You. Being able to get someone fired up while just being yourself is your biggest asset.

Nico is amazing! But as someone that Nico approves of, you’re not so bad yourself.
