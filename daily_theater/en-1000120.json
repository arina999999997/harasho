Ehehe~, just like an adult. Karin-san, Thank you zura~♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eFufu, this is the best makeup I’ve done yet if I can say so myself. Let’s go over it one more time to see if you can do it yourself\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eSure♪ This is the first time that Maru has used eyeliner. It’s kind of scary that you apply it so close to the eyes. But with practice, Maru can do it too, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eOf course! But, suddenly wanting to learn about makeup, did something happen?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eHmm…. Maru is just at that age♡\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eAt that age….? Ah, I remembered. You also asked Eli-chan to teach you ballet didn’t you, Hanamaru-chan? I heard that at that time you went and ate tendon with her….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eYeah! Eli-san told that to you too, huh. Karin-san, do you also want to go eat a make-your-own original Tendon?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eThat seems fun, but Tendon is a bit high in calories….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eIt’s okay Zura! Maru’s got Kanan-chan’s Hell Triathlon, so!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eHell Triathlon? I’ve got a feeling that I’ve heard that before….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eAll these talking about Tendon made Maru really want to eat one now. Karin-san, Let’s go! Quickly!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eEeh!? Wait, Hanamaru-chan! Wait-!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
