Isn’t it a little too short....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eIs that so, I thought it looked cute, though.... Ah, then how about this one?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eN-, no way! It’s embarrassing enough to wear a miniskirt like this in lives, let alone as casual clothing....!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eUmi-chan, think about it the other way around. If you can wear this in lives, then it should be fine if you wear it casually. Besides, this one really fits you, Umi-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eI-, I understand, I’ll try it on for now....

It’s cute, but I wonder if I could pull off the look.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eIf you can wear it as a live outfit, wearing it as casual clothes shouldn’t be a problem, Nozomi.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eWell, you’re right. I won’t know until I try it on, right!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eThen it’s decided. Let’s try them on and show each other outside of the fitting room!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
