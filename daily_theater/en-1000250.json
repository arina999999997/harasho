It’s the same as that! Listen to my request too~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eSeriously, just how far has that story spread....? Look, even someone like me have requests that I would and wouldn’t listen to\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eBut.... when I saw this uniform, I thought, “This uniform was made to be worn by Maki-chan!”.... Put a belt around a khaki jacket, show a peek of white shirt and navy blue necktie from the chest area. A tight skirt and a firm stance on a full-body silhouette.... See? Isn’t this basically you, Maki-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003e“See”? What do you mean “See”? I don’t get it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eDo you need more explanation? How much more do I have to explain until you wear it?
