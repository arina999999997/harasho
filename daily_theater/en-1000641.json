Maru wishes Maru had worn more layers~. Maru didn’t think Tokyo would be this cold zura....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eIt’s hard to decide what to wear around this time of the year. I feel like it’s too early to wear a midwinter coat, but an autumn coat would be too cold....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eMaru’s knitted coat might be a mistake too~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eHey, get a little bit closer to me. Let’s both use my stole.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eEeeh!? Won’t you be cold then, Maki-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eThat’s why I’m telling you to get closer. If we huddle up, we won’t be that cold, and each of us can use half of the stole.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eThen.... Fuaaah, it’s so warm~. Maru never knew that not having your neck exposed to the winds can be so much warmer~! Also.... let’s get some hot chocolate from that food truck over there! Maru will treat you as thanks for sharing this stole!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eI guess it can’t be helped. But we’re supposed to eat pancakes after this, right? Let’s also share the chocolate so we won’t be full.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
