A recommendation for Honoka-san.... Let’s see....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eYeah, yeah! ....Wait, Setsuna-chan, why do you look so serious?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI have quite a hard time making recommendations. I need to consider both the quality of the work and your tastes, Honoka-san. Do you have any tropes that you like? Something like a heated battle or a passionate friendship....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eHmm, let’s see.... I guess I like stories about friends working together. I can totally relate to those.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eIn that case, I can narrow it down to three series. If you like, how about we watch them at my place?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eEeh, can I!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYes! Let’s buy some snacks and have a watch party!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eI want to buy bread too!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
