You’re welcome anytime. So, what did you want to talk with me about?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYes, umm…. Ever since I started as a school idol, I’ve been worrying about balancing it with my external activities…. Volunteering. So I wanted to ask you for tips on how you use your time because you’ve been helping hard here, Nozomi-san\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eEeh!? I think you’re amazing for working so hard as a volunteer and as a school idol while being the student council president, you know, Shioriko-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYou also juggle being a school idol, helping here, and being Eli-san’s right hand in the student council, Nozomi-san. How do you efficiently use your time? I know it’s selfish of me, but I want to put as much effort into all of them as I can\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003e….There, there\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eEh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eThere’s only one thing I’ll say. Shioriko-chan, you shouldn’t overdo it. The desire to put your all into everything may tire you out little by little, Shioriko-chan. That’s why, for now, why don’t you focus only on what’s in front of you? Don’t think about everything all at once, okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eNozomi-san….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eWith that said, let’s put all of your efforts into watching the beautiful fallen leaves dance with me right now~. Help me clean them up later, okay♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
