There are lots of fireworks festivals in the summer, right? Lanzhu wants to have one here at Nijigaku too!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eHey, just so we’re clear here, when you say “fireworks”, you’re talking about sparklers, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eOf course Lanzhu’s talking about the ones that go off with a bang!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eWait, wait, wait. You do know those require you to take a difficult exam and get certified in them, right!? You don’t just go out and “learn” how to make them!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eSo not even Lanzhu can?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eOf course not. Let’s just go with regular sparklers. If we light them with everyone, they can be really fun too. Let’s go buy some.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003e...Fine. Until Lanzhu gets certified, I guess we’ll just have to settle for sparklers. Alright, let’s give these sparklers our all! Come on, Mia!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eHey~!
