It didn’t go so well at the time due to my inexperience.... I’ve been wanting to do it again, properly this time. So with the help of Setsuna-san, Umi-san, Hanamaru-san, and Shioriko-san, I’ve made a proper script!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eHaaah....? Uhh, Yohane isn’t really an act, you know? That’s why I don’t need a script, okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eAs expected of Yohane-san....! You can always do it without a script, huh....! I feel ashamed of myself for not being able to bring out my best without a script. But I’ll give it my all, so please, read this!

Please give me a birthday present from you, Yohane-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eIt’s not fair to bring up presents! Alright, fine!
