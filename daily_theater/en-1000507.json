What should I do with them?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eAlright, crack those eggs into a bowl, then stir them.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI understand!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003e....Nico-san, is this enough?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eHmm, it looks fine. All you have to do now is to season and fry it. Tamagoyaki is surprisingly simple, so I think even you can make it once you learn how, Setsuna.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eWaaah, I’m so happy! I’ve always wanted to create a dish that I could call my specialty. I’ll do my best!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eYeah, as a school idol, it doesn’t hurt to be able to cook. Keep at it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eOkay!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eSheesh, I heard that Setsuna is a terrible cook, but she can do it if she tries. I was worried over nothing.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eThe seasoning should pack a punch to make it more filling, right.... Maybe some pepper and.... tabasco? Aaah, it might be better to add some protein to make it more nutritious....!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
