I wasn’t laughing at you because you were making a weird face or anything, Nico-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eOooooooobviously! There’s no way the number one idol in the universe, Nico, would ever make a weird face! So, what is it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eUmm, I just thought it was cute that you were eating Kashiwa mochi.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0009/\u003eHaah?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eKashiwa mochi are made with the hope that whoever eats them will grow up healthy, right?
