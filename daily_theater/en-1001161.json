What happened?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eKasumi and the others treated me like a kid. I’m a college student in the States and a third-year student here!

Hey Umi, let’s go grab some hamburgers!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eThat’s not a good idea. If you eat something like that as a snack, you won’t have room for dinner.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eStop treating me like a kid!!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
