It was very delicious!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eEhehe, I’m glad you liked it~! Hey hey, we at Homura are making a new fruit daifuku menu. Do you have any recommendations for it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eDo you really want my opinion on it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eWell, you seem to know a lot about current trends! I’d like to have something you don’t see much elsewhere, you know, as the main draw!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eSomething you don’t see much elsewhere.... huh? There’s a local island that specializes in passion fruit and lemon. I don’t think you see those very often, so how about those?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eMhmm. Passion fruit and lemon, alright....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eThey might be hard to use on a fruit daifuku, though.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eAhaha, I’ll tell my mom that. Thanks for the advice, Karin-san! Here, take some of our manjuu as thanks!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eMy, thank you, but I feel bad that I’m the only one benefitting from this. Let me buy some for Emma and the others as well.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eThank you very much~! I’ll give you some extra, okay!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
