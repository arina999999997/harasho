Maybe we can defeat it this time......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eWe have my loadout. Have some confidence! Okay, it’s starting!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eUhh..... like this. Whoa, the hit landed! Awesome! And then this..... Yay! Just a little more! ......We did it! We defeated it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eYeah! Now we have new resources!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYup! We can make even stronger weapons now. Thanks for the help, Mia-chan~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eHehe, if you run into any more problems in the future, just let me know. I’m good at this game.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eThank you! Ruby will be relying on you then. How can Ruby repay you...... Maybe with Aqours’s special training methods?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eUm, uh, don’t worry about it. Kanan comes up with the practice routines for Aqours, right? I heard about them from Kasumi......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eThat’s right! Kanan-chan trains us hard, but Ruby thinks we definitely benefit from her routines.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eUmmm, then, maybe next time...... Ahaha......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
