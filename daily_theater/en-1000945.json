Have you seen the weather forecast for today?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eHm? It’s supposed to be pretty hot out~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eI see. Then, let’s shorten our running distance today and cancel practice on the rooftop. There’s no shade there.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eAlright. We have to be careful, after all. Ah, why don’t we ask if we could use the area behind the shrine? There should be adequate shade and a nice breeze there.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eOh, really?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eAs long as we don’t bother anyone coming to the shrine to pray, it should be fine.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eOkay, let’s ask them then.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eEli-chi, you’re also changing the training schedule and making it appropriate for the weather, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eObviously. We have to put on performances that Aqours and Nijigasaki will look up to.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eFufu, I’ll leave it to you then. With your fever, everything will go swimmingly.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
