Also, can you sit around there and wait?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEh? O-, okay....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003e(W-, what should I do.... I wonder if it’s because I made a mistake earlier even though we’re in a joint practice.... Maybe Kanan-san is mad at me....)\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThanks for waiting~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eK-, Kanan-san, I’m sorry!
