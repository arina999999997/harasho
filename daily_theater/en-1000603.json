I saw Ruby and the others play it and tried it for myself, but I also found it quite difficult.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eHmm.... I need to learn the special mechanics of the puzzles....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eAh, Rina-san. Right there!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eWaaah, amazing! That destroyed so many blocks!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eFufu, and level cleared!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eDia-san.... for someone that claimed it was difficult.... you’re really good.

It’s not something that praiseworthy, though....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
