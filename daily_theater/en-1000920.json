Did something happen?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eAh, Eli-san. Yes, I’ve been entrusted with a big role!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eMy, a new play? I’d love an invite.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eFufu, you’re going to be part of it, Eli-san♪ It seems that Mari-san and Honoka-san had an extremely fun test of courage experience, so they talked about how we should do another one utilizing Nijigaku’s school buildings. And I will be performing the last part of the show, the colossal ghost.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eEh.... I-, is that so?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYeah. I’m really looking forward to it. Nijigaku’s buildings are spacious, so I think we can do lots of cool things in them.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003e....Has the school given you permission to do that? Safety must really be considered when planning such a big project like that. I’ll be making sure everything is good, okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eSafety, huh....?
