What do you think, Kasumi-san?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003e*Sigh*~, no good. You’re too stiff, Shioko~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYou’re right.... I look awkward even from my perspective....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eBut it’s better than yesterday! Let’s practice a lot today so you can make a cuter pose tomorrow!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eY-, yes. I’ll do my best!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eMhmm, good. You see, Kasumin thinks that it’s the angle of your shoulder and elbow that makes it look stiff~. The more you think about it, the more you’ll lose sight of it, so it’s probably better to get your body used to your best pose.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eDo you also practice a lot, Kasumi-san?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eKasumin is inherently cute, so it comes naturally to me! Or so Kasumin would like to say.... Kasumin is aiming to be even cuter, so Kasumin has done a bu~nch of research.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eKasumi-san.... I’ll work hard. I’ll do my best to be cute too!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eWell, Kasumin is the cutest, but Kasumin is also becoming cuter and cuter, so you better give it your all, Shioko. You’re good at remembering postures and form because you’re studying traditional dances, right? Just think of poses as the same thing.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI see.... I am good at that! Let’s do it one more time, Kasumi-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
