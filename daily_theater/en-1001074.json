That’s the first time I’ve seen you wear that coat.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eOh, I bought this a few days ago. I’m happy you noticed. 𝅘𝅥𝅮\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eI see. That long coat really suits you. It looks classy yet trendy.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eThanks! 𝅘𝅥𝅮\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eEverything you wear looks classy yet trendy, Karin. Is there a trick behind finding clothing like that?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eI don’t think you could call this a trick, but you have to look for things that match you.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eThings that match you, huh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eYeah. For example, I usually focus on long coats when I go shopping for coats. Because of my height, long coats tend to look better on me than short coats.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eI see...... Karin, can I ask you for a favor? Could you come shopping with me sometime? I want a new coat too, but I’m having trouble finding the right one......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eNo problem! 𝅘𝅥𝅮 I’d be happy to look for a nice coat for you, Umi-chan. Let’s go find a great coat together! 𝅘𝅥𝅮\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
