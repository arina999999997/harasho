Everyone hates this training plan, though....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eIf you dislike it, that means it’s tough. If it’s tough, that means you will definitely get better after you do it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhaha, that’s true. I’m sure it will get you stronger. Then, let’s start with a warmup. We’ll go for a run on the beach\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eRunning on the beach.... There was a scene like that in an old sports drama that I saw on DVD! I actually kind of want to experience that atmosphere....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eEh? What do you mean?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eShouting at the setting sun! Something like, “You idiot sun!”. But the sun hasn’t done anything wrong, has it. I wonder why they say that?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eI don’t know either. If it were me, I would’ve probably said, “Don’t set just yet!”. After all, when it gets dark, you can’t practice anymore\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eI get that! Umm, can we try shouting.... after we finish running on the beach? Something like a vocal practice....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhaha, good idea! Let’s do it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
