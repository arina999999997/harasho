When Maru thinks of going through the hell triathlon, Maru’s vision goes black zura….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eHanamaru-chan…. Umm, it’s about the hell triathlon, it seems that Umi-chan talked to Kanan-chan about it and it got a power up….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eEeeh-----!?!? No…. Maru can’t take it zura…. Even though Maru can’t stop shivering whenever Maru remembers the sight of Yoshiko-chan after she did the trial version, to think that it got a power up…. Guh\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eI don’t think I could do it either…. The more I think about it, the harder it feels….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eHey, Hanayo-chan, what if the two of us train in secret? At this rate, Maru thinks that we’ll definitely not be able to keep up\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eYeah, that’s right…. We have to work hard at what we can do first, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eFirst of all, swimming…. We don’t have our swimsuit with us right now, so that’s not possible. Next, bicycling…. It’s just pedaling so we might be fine. Then, Running…. Maru isn’t very good at running, so let’s start with that\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eThat seems good. But, if we run a lot immediately our bodies will get shocked, so should we start with a brisk walk?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eWaah, a brisk walk is fun, and Maru feels like Maru can keep going zura!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEhehe. Let’s do our best on our secret training♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
