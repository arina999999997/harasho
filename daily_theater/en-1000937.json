It was my summer homework. I’d love for you to playtest it, You-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eOf course, of course! Can I pick the character?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eMhmm.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eAh, this character looks like Chika-chan~ Huh? This looks like Ai-chan......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eI based the character designs off of everyone.

This dungeon is a bit too difficult, don’t you think?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003e......Really, is that so? Everyone else in Nijigaku has played it before, but no one could escape the dungeon either...... My game is a failure......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eNo, no, no, it’s not a failure. It’s really well made. Watch, I’ll be the first one to clear this!
