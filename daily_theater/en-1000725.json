What’s wrong?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby got a bad score on a quiz.... And Ruby showed it to Onee-chan....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eDid you get scolded? Well, there’s love behind every scolding. Dia must’ve also been thinking about-\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYeah, Ruby knows that. Honoka-san told me that before. She said that whenever you and Kotori-san scold her, she would feel loved as much as she felt sorry for it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eH-, Honoka said that!? No, I’ll deal with her later. Let’s focus on Ruby for now.... If even Honoka said that, surely you understand that Dia is just conveying her love to you, Ruby.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eBut.... Onee-chan didn’t scold me. She just told me to do my best next time and patted my head to make me feel better.... That’s why Ruby feels ashamed of myself....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eSo that’s why....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003e....Okay. Ruby will study more and get a score that Ruby can proudly show Onee-chan! Umi-san, can you look after me?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eWhat a wonderful sisterly love.... I’m so touched! By all means, leave it to me! Let’s respond to Dia with a perfect score!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
