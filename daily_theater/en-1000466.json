That’s amazing, Shizuku-chan! I think my image of angels has just changed~. So angels aren’t just full of kindness, huh.... The lines about how she’s cold to the fallen angel Yoshiko-chan because she cared so much about her were soooo coooool~!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eEhehehe. I-, I’m getting embarrassed if you praise me that much. Besides, this script was only possible with the aid of many people. I also borrowed Umi-san’s help for it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eEh!? Umi-chan never said anything about that~! I want to try doing it too~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eReally!? I also want to see your acting, Honoka-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eBut if I’m doing it, what role do you think I should play?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eLet’s see....

Both are appealing, and I also want to be friends with both sides~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThen, how about we talk to Umi-san about it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eYeah, let’s do that!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
