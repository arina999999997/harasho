Isn’t it as cute as me?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eDon’t call me Yohako, it’s Yohane.... To be satisfied with just a cute poster, I guess that shows you still have much more to learn.... Behold, this is the poster Yohane made for Aqours!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eUwah, so eerie!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eAt least say it has a profound atmosphere! Look, the pattern here is based on a magic circle. This one is based on medicinal herbs used in mystic arts. This one is from magical tools.... Oh, and this area is filled with the ominous aura of a fallen angel. It’s filled to the brim with fallen angel characteristics!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003e....Characteristics.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eKukuku, that’s right! Do you even have anything that shows your characteristics on your poster!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003e....Kasumin was naive.

How is it? Kasumin tried to express my miracle lovely being by combining hearts, stars, flowers, ribbons, and many other things♡\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003e....It kind of looks like a geometry pattern.... Pretty cool.... Cool enough that I want to adopt that for my own.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0202/\u003eAaaah! It’s not cool, it’s cute~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
