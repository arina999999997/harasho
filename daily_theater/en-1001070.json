How could I make a more impactful entrance at our performances?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eHuh... So you’re saying that what you’ve been doing won’t work?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eMaking an entrance that’ll leave an impact on the audience is important! If you’ve ever watched them, scenes where the hero of justice appears leave a big impact every time!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eThen why don’t you make an entrance like those heroes of justice, Setsuna?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eY-you’re right!! You’re totally right, Mia-san! I’ll just think of a way to appear like a hero at our next live!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0212/\u003eNice. So that solves it then.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eNo, not yet! The hero’s entrance scene always has some cool background music to go with it!
