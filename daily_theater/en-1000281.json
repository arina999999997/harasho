There is a considerable amount of magical energy spreading through the ground in this spot\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eEh!? Harajuku is that kind of place!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eOrdinary people wouldn’t realize it, obviously. It’s an immense amount of dark energy that only this Yohane can take in\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eNo way.... I’ve never known that. Is it.... dangerous if we stay here for an extended period?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eAs long as you’re near Yohane, it’s fine. But when you’re alone just as a little demon.... There’s no telling what would happen\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eI come here often with Honoka and Kotori, but should I refrain from doing so in the future?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eKukuku.... It’s okay, from today, Yohane shall absorb all the magic that comes out from this place\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eYou’re able to do that!? To be honest, I’ve been skeptical about you, Yoshiko, but I’ve changed my view about you. Please make this place a safe place for us all to play in. If there’s anything I can do to help, I will do so\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eKuukuku. There’s nothing you can do as a little demon. Also, it’s Yohane, okay....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eI’m.... powerless, huh.... I understand. I’ll be in your care, Yohane\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
