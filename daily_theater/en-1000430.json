I was wondering if I should remake it or give it a try.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eAh, was it the one that Nozomi-chan was talking about?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eYes, that’s it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eYou made it because you want Aqours to level up, right?
