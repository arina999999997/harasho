Haha, you seem excited!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eThat’s because today’s weather is excellent for clamming! Eli-san, hmm... your outfit looks good, zura.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eBut I wonder if we’re wearing too much. Wouldn’t we get hot?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eThat’s why we’re wearing long sleeves. It’ll hurt if you get sunburned. Don’t forget to keep your hat on and a towel around your neck to protect your body. With that said, let’s get digging~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eHmm...... they’re all so tiny.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eUgh, it's not supposed to be like this~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eYou can't always get what you want from nature. I found another place that looks fun, though. How about we go play on the rocky beach over there? It's too hot to just sit around, so let's play in the water.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eOkay, let's go! Let’s play and get rid of all this stress, zura~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
