It’s so cold~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eHanayo-san, do you know the trick to keep your body warm?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEh? Umm.... Wear lots of layers?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eThat’s one way to do it. However, there’s a trick to help you fight off the cold, even with light clothing. That is to warm up your “neck joints”.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eMy.... “neck joints”?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eOf course, you have to keep your actual neck warm, but you will truly feel the difference if you also warm up your wrists and ankles. As an example.... Here, please wear my gloves.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEeeh!? But then you’re the one who’ll be cold, Dia-san! I’ll be fine! I can drink something warm to heat my body up from the inside!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eFrom the inside, huh....? Fufu, that might be the best way, after all. Why don’t we each wear one glove? Then both of us could get some warm drinks together.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eDia-san.... Then, I’ll be taking one. Thank you! Let’s hold our other hands together on the way there!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eAh, Hanayo-san! Please don’t run off so suddenly like that~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
