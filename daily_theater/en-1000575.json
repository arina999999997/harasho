You have so many lipsticks, Mari-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eYeah. When browsing through cosmetics at the store, I ended up wanting lots of different colors. I thought I’d match them with the season or my outfit, but before I knew it, they had piled up~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eThat’s nice. I also wanted to buy some cute lipsticks, but there are so many colors that I don’t know which to choose.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eIs that so? Hmm~, I think this light pink one suits you, Hanayo. Hey, would you like to try it on?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eMay I?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eOf course! You’ll know how it would look on you better if you try it before buying, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eThank you.

Umm.... I can put it on myself, you know....? Besides, it’s a little embarrassing to have you do it for me....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eFufu, your shy side is so cute, Hanayo, but you can leave this to me.
