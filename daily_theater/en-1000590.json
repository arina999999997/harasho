You came to see me!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eYeah. I’ve never been to a high diving tournament before, but I’m really excited. Everyone is so good!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eAhaha, thank you. It’s the kind of competition where everyone practices real hard, so it wouldn’t be weird for anyone to win.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eYou’re right.... But, I want you to win, You-san. That’s why, if you’d like, I’ve prepared some refreshments for you.... Here.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eWhat is it? Let’s see.... Waah, onigiri! It’s huge, huh!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eI put side dishes inside the onigiri. I thought it would be easier to eat that way....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eI see, very convenient.... Thank you, Hanayo-chan! Rice is great because it turns into energy really quickly.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEhehe, I’m glad. Then, do your best in the second half too!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eI will! I’ll claim victory with the power of onigiri!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
