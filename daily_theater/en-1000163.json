I bought…. sunflower seeds. Want to plant together?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eHeeh, today is sunflower day huh~ But, if Kanata remembers correctly~.... Aren’t they supposed to be planted a bit ago? Kanata remembers planting them in a pot around May back in elementary….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eI see…. I’m too late, I guess…. Rina-chan’s board「Sad」\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eWaah! But, but, it’s okay to start now! If we place it on the sunniest spot in the clubroom, water it everyday, and let it hear our songs, it’ll definitely do it’s best~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eIs it the same as…. playing classical music for vegetables?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eThat’s right, it really works~. Kanata’s teacher talked about it, so. Since we’re going to plant one, we might as well do our best to take care of it and have it bloom into a bi~g flower\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eYes…. I’ll work hard. Rina-chan’s board「Passionate」\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eIt’ll be great if it can bloom into a big flower and produce a lot of seeds. Once we get the seeds, let’s eat them~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eEh, you can eat them?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eLook, it says “edible” on the bag, right? It has a sweet smell and is really delicious~. Ehe, Kanata can’t wait~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
