You see, Rina-chan told me about this rice cultivating game. Rice cultivation in the real world is really hard, but I thought if it’s in a game, then maybe.... But it’s still hard even in a game....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0104/\u003eLet me take a look at it. ....I see, it’s quite realistic\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eYeah.
