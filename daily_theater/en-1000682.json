I’m really looking forward to seeing you use it on your next live, Rina-chan.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eI want to thank you. Is there.... anything I could do?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eEh? It’s fine, you don’t have to!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eNo, I insist.

I’ll help you think of something.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eFufu, it might take a while, so I’ll also bring out some cookies I made yesterday.
