Alright, we’re done!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003ePhew, good work, Kanan. Need a drink?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThank you! *Gulp gulp*.... Haaah, that hits the spot~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eThank you again for organizing a joint training between μ’s and Aqours today. I learned a lot from seeing Aqours’ training methods.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eNo no, that’s my line! Knowing the performance that μ’s gives is built upon this type of basic training rekindled my spirit.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eFufu, I guess we both wanted to take good points from the other to make our own training even better, huh.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eYeah. After all, school idols might be rivals of each other, but we’re also friends who love the same thing, right? That’s why we all want to improve each other.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eYou’re right, we respect everyone in Aqours and Nijigaku. And to the same degree, we always think we need to give a performance that makes people around us see that we do.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhaha, Aqours said the exact same thing the other day. I guess we’ve become an integral existence to each other before we knew it, huh~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eFufu, it seems so♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
