You sounded like a panda with a stomach ache.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eAh, Karin-san. The thing is, I can’t settle on the design for my next costume.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eLet me take a look, okay? ......Ah, I see.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eI want to try and balance the elements that I like and elements that fit the song’s image. Otherwise, it’ll be too cluttered!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eThere should be three distinct design elements. 70 percent should be the costume’s key point, 20 percent should be what you really want to add, and the remaining 10 percent should be something that links the previous two elements together. That’s what I take into consideration when I design clothes in class. You can finetune how to balance them afterward.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eI see...... Okay, I’ll go make some revisions!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eTake a look, Karin-san! What do you think?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0204/\u003eIt looks great! But hold on. Could you...... include bunny ears?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
