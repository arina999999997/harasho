Today’s play was really interesting nya~!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThank you! I’m glad to hear that.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eYou were so cool nya~! But you were so different from your usual self. Rin doesn’t know how you can do that.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eEhehe. I actually built up today’s role with people around me as references.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eReally?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eI took the cool part from Karin-san and Kanan-san and the strong-willed part from Emma-san and Nico-san....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eIs that so~. Rin can kinda see it nya~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eBut the most important aspect of this role is the pure and innocent part. Without it, the cool part wouldn’t stand out.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eHeeeh~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eAnd that’s why I put together that part of the performance with you in mind, Rin-san♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eEeeh—!? Then that means.... That Rin was a part of the play too....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYeah! I was able to act it out thanks to everyone’s help!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThat’s amazing nya—-!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
