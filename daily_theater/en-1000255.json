But…. it’s hard\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eIt’s okay. Look, you already remember which keys to hold down with your right hand, after that is to just not rush and focus on the sound. The piano makes such a lovely sound, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eI like the way…. it resonates with my body\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eFufu, me too. Since you seem good on the right-hand part, next is the left-hand part. The left-hand part is easy. You just need to alternately hold here and here down\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eUu…. Uuuu~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eYou can do it….!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eIt’s hard…. It’s really hard to…. move your left and right hand separately…. But…. I want to play this song\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eThen, I’ll do the left-hand part, so should we play through it once? I’ll leave the right-hand part to you, Rina-chan\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eYes! I’m happy to play with you, Riko-san…. So…. I’ll do my best!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
