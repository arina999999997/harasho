It’s good to have a friend. Both Zuramaru and Ruby said they’re done because they did it bit by bit every day.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eHmm, I don’t know how to feel about you thinking that I haven’t done it from the start.... But you’re right, so I can’t exactly say anything.... So, which ones have you not finished yet, Yoshiko-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eMath and English, of course. I guess the book report too~. And the one I’m having the most trouble with, the research project. I know they said that we can research whatever we want, but what am I supposed to do?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThe research project, huh~. Ah, then, how about I help you with that, Yoshiko-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eEh, really!? But what are we going to research?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eWell, you have this beautiful sea in front of you right here in Uchiura, you know? How about researching marine creatures? Since we’re here, why don’t we go diving after this and find some new species or something?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0106/\u003eI see, that does sound interesting. But isn’t that just an excuse because you want to go diving, Kanan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eAhaha, you saw right through me, huh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
