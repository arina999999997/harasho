As the weather gets hotter, doing too intense a workout could be harmful. But we can’t improve if we only do light workouts just because it’s hot.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eUmi-san, you put that much thought into creating our training schedule?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eWell, it’s not like I have it all figured out. I’ve read a few books on it, and there are many different approaches and ways of thinking. I’m also not sure whether or not they would suit us...\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eSo in the end, we really have to try things out ourselves and judge based on that, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eYes, all we can do is try things out and keep searching for what works best for us through trial and error.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eAmazing... Everyone in μ’s is really amazing! I want to be fearless in the face of trial and error too, and take on all kinds of challenges!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eAny and all challenges?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYes!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eSetsuna... Would you like to try mountain climbing training with me? Mountain climbing is fantastic as a leisure activity, but it also has many benefits as a form of training.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eReally? I’d love to learn more about it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eGreat!! It’s the perfect season for it right now.
