But was I really that useful? You were the one who decided the route for the trail run, and I was just following behind, you know, Kanan-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eNo, you were a huge help. I know the dangerous locations in my local mountains, but that’s usually because other people told me about them, so I didn’t really understand why they are dangerous. But you taught me how to recognize them by how the trees grew or by the grasses that grew on them, right, Emma-chan? That’s really useful knowledge. It’s going to help me a lot with future route planning!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eIs that so? But, if you’re happy about it, then it must be so, right. Fufu, I’m glad. Ah, that’s right! Ayumu-chan gave me something. She told me to share it with you, so I brought it with me\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eHmm? What is it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eTa-da! It’s honey lemon~! You can make delicious soda with this~. And it’ll taste even better if you put in a little bit of grated ginger!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eUwaa, amazing! I want to try drinking a honey lemon soda! ....But, how about we make it taste way better.... by going for another round of trail run!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eIt’ll taste even better? Sure, I’ll go!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eA reward also makes us practice harder, right. Let’s go!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eYeah!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
