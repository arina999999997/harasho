There are many things that you can only do at the sea. But in the same way, there are also real pleasures that you can only experience at the mountains\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eI get that much. But the sea is the birthplace of mankind right? There are ancient memories etched into our DNA that we just can’t resist\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eHmm…. That is a weak reasoning…. Even so, humanity has been alive for 200 thousand years. Being on land all that time means being surrounded by greenery, a place full of negative ions…. That’s right, won’t the mountains be a pleasant and comfortable place to spend time?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eYou’re bringing up human history?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eBut you’re the one to bring it up first, Kanan….

Should we go ask Ai-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eAi…. Let’s not do that\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eEh, why?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eIf we ask Ai, she’ll probably say something along the lines of “Both the sea and the mountains are a fun place! But Ai-san also loves Harajuku!”\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThat does sound like something she would say….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
