Don’t you think Kanan-chan doesn’t think much of it either?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003e….To have forgotten that we are fellow school idols who work hard together and learn from each other and went on a rant about the wonders of the mountains…. No, it’s true that I do think all of humanity should know the wonders of the mountains. But if Kanan is willing to say that much, the sea must also have a charm that I do not know of…. Haa, I’m so immature….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0007/\u003eHmm, I don’t think it’s bad to preach about stuff that you love.
