Our pound cake turned out great~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eWow! It smells so good~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eHehe, it looks really good too~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eIt’s all thanks to you, Emma. Lanzhu thought she’d make it alone, but she’s glad she asked for your help. I thought that filling it up with tons of nuts and cranberries would make it look more gorgeous, but I wasn’t sure how much to put in...\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eAhaha... I get wanting to add in a lot, but if you want to make the cake as a whole taste good, the overall harmony is very important.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eSo making sweets is just like QU4RTZ! Lanzhu’ll be sure to study it. Next time, I’ll be able to make it just right!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eLet’s let it cool down for a bit and then wrap it up.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eDo you think Mia will forgive me if I give her this?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eAs long as you add an “I’m sorry”, I’m sure she will! You two will make up in no time!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eThen until this pound cake cools down, Lanzhu will practice her apology! Emma, tell Lanzhu how well she’s doing it!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
