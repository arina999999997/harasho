It’s pretty good.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eHonoka, Chika, and Ayumu put it together, right? I’d say they did quite well.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eThis is just a guess, but.... I think Honoka and Chika just came up with whatever they wanted to do, and Ayumu was the one compiling them.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003e....That does seem highly likely.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0108/\u003eAhaha.... But it sounds like an interesting project to take on, doesn’t it? Very exciting~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eIt’s a challenging one, so we need to make sure that we split the work equally.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eThat’s right.
