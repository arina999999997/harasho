Here’s one of my recommended books. I hope you’ll like it....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eWaah, thank you, Shizuku-chan! What kind of book is it?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eIt’s about spies! I’ve been really into spy stories recently. This one is about how the enemy spy that the main character has been chasing for so long turned out to be their childhood friend.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEeeh!? Their childhood friend is.... their enemy?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eUmm.... Yeah, but.... There are plenty of other shocking plot points and developments!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eI can’t believe the protagonist is fighting their own childhood friend.... I wonder how they felt when they found out.... It’s too painful for me to even begin to imagine....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003e....Please don’t worry! The protagonist thought that they were the enemy at first. But after listening to their story, the protagonist realized that they were the one being deceived all along. The childhood friend was actually trying to free the protagonist from the true enemy!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eR-, really!? Wow.... what a great friendship!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eI’m sorry.... I spoiled it for you.... If you want, I can give you another book.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eNo, it’s fine! I’m okay with this book. I really want to read it! Thanks for the wonderful book, Shizuku-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
