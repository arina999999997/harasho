Being a little demon isn’t just simple cosplay. You should wear something more noble and majestic.

It does suit you. I guess I have no choice. Here, you can borrow some of Yohane’s items. This hat, the cape, and these lace gloves will make you look even better. Okay..... There. Much better.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eWow! This is awesome!!
