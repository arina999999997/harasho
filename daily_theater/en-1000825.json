I can’t think of anything. They’ll always be the protagonist’s sworn rival, right? And they’ll always have opposing ideologies?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYes, those are both given. It’s a recurring theme, and as their disagreement grows larger, the antagonist evolves further into a monster.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eAnother recurring theme is that the protagonist and the antagonists used to be best friends. But as they grow up, their values and morals grow more and more divided......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eA-Are there cases where they were childhood friends!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI’ve seen that quite often.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eThose stories are always heartrending. The last time I watched a movie with a story like that, I got quite choked up.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eYeah... I can see how that would be painful to watch...... But I get it now. Monsters can be quite fascinating too!! Could I write the script for our play then, please?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYou want to do it, Ayumu-san!? ......That would be awesome! Shizuku and I might only have cliché ideas in mind, so I think you’ll come up with something Shizuku and I could never come up with!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eYeah! You might have a new point of view that we don’t have! Please come up with a scenario that makes the most of your fresh perspective, Ayumu-san!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eAlright, leave it to me! I’ll do my best!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
