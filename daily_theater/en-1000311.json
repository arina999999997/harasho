Wawaah, the flower is falling over~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eLet’s get some help from the flower with a thick stem next to it. If you let them intertwine with one another.... There, it stood up beautifully\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eOooh, you’re right!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYou have a good eye for 3D space and color schemes, huh, Kanan-san. I think you have a talent for flower arrangement\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eEh, really? I didn’t realize at all....
