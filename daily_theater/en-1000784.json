Tokyo is amazing~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eFufufu. I come here often with that person. It’s one of my favorites. I thought you would like it too, Ruby-chan, so I’m glad we came here together.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eSo this is where you usually go on dates, huh, Ayumu-san?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eDates!? Uhh, it’s not like that. Umm, we would just have tea and a little chat like always, so....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eHm? Ruby goes on a lot of dates with Onee-chan, though? With Hanamaru-chan and Yoshiko-chan too.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eAh.... T-, that’s right. A date between friends! Today I’m on a date with you, after all, Ruby-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYeah! Hey Ayumu-san, what do you recommend here?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eProbably the mille crepes. I also recommend the latte art here. It’s adorable. There are many different ones, like leaves, hearts, and bears. It makes you excited about what you’re going to get each time.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby would like to try that!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eI’ll also order one then. I wonder what it’s going to be this time!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
