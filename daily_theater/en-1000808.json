This shumai has Japanese rice sprinkled around it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003e*Munch*.... Hnn~, it’s so good! The combination of rice and shumai is the best~. So, what were you saying earlier?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eAh, that’s right. After that, Lanzhu happened to see Nijigaku sing at the center stage. Lanzhu still remembers the shock Lanzhu got from that!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eI know right~~!? I also remember the first time I saw school idols too! I was instantly entranced by them. I couldn’t move even after the live was over. And when I got home they were all I could think about.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eSo you do get it! Yeah, Lanzhu couldn’t forget that performance even after Lanzhu went back to Hong Kong, so Lanzhu kept watching their videos online.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eMhmm, that’s right. I also watch a ton of their videos.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eIt made me love Nijigaku even more and got me thinking that I had to go to Nijigaku. Lanzhu thought that those girls are going to be my friends!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eI’m also a friend of yours now, right, Lanzhu-san?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0211/\u003eKyaaah! Of course, Hanayo! Lanzhu loves everyone from μ’s! Lanzhu watches at least 10 videos as a routine each night before bed!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEeeh!? Which songs!? Also, I’m curious about the rest of your routine~! Tell me, Lanzhu-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
