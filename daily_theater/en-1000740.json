Umi-san, You-san, you are also in two different clubs like me, right? That means you both also live two separate lives.... That’s right! I’m talking about your second self! Both of you are also enjoying life as your other self, right!?!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eEh? But I’m only one person, though....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eThat’s a very you-like thing to say, Shizuku-chan~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eEeeh!? So you mean.... the two of you don’t have a second self? Even though you’re juggling two clubs?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eUmm.... I don’t know how to say this, but I don’t think so....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eI’ve never thought about it like that. But it certainly sounds interesting. How does your drama club self differ from your idol club self, Shizuku-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eAs my drama club self, I hope everyone who sees my play will be moved by it, even just a little bit. But as my idol self, I want to continue striving for the best and hope everyone who sees my performance.... Huh? It’s the same....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eFufu, I guess both Shizuku really want to move people’s hearts, don’t they?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eYeah, and I’m sure you can do it, Shizuku! You’re working twice as hard for both the drama club and the idol club, after all!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eI-, is that so? Then I will continue to give it my all! Thank you so much, Umi-san, You-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
