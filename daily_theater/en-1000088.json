I got an idea, what if we add this seasoning in? Wouldn’t it add a punch to the hidden flavor?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eSetsuna-chan, you shouldn’t add a punch in a hidden flavor, okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI see, because it’s supposed to be hidden right. Then, what about this one? It hides the taste with a completely different taste!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eHmm…. Wouldn’t it be better if you use this one instead?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eThen, what about this one, this one, and this one? I think it helps bring out a deep flavor\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eA deep flavor, would that really come out….? Won’t it make the flavor confusing….? Setsuna-chan, we really should hide a hidden flavor, so let’s keep it to 1 type alright?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eIs that so…. That’s too bad, but if Ayumu-san says so\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eOkay. My part is done for now. Setsuna-chan, I’ll leave the mixing to you♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eIt’s really good! You made it really tasty, Setsuna-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYeah, it’s delicious! Let’s make sweets again, Ayumu-san!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
