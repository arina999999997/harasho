Was it refreshing?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eRefreshing....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eThe rest of Aqours consulted me. They said you’re not the type to whine about things, so they wanted to give you some refreshing time. You sure have good friends\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eEh.... Eeeeh!? How!? How could they....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eYou see, the more things you try to hide from your friends, the more they will see through you\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0105/\u003eUuu.... This is really embarrassing.... How should I even face them tomorrow!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eJust greet them like you usually do.
