Hmm, I wonder what I should write? Have you decided yet, Ruby-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby was thinking of doing “Funkotsusaishin”. It means, “To do things as hard as you can with all of your might”\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eHow wonderful! I want to write that too! What does the kanji look like?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eIt’s like this\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003e....I think it may be a little bit too hard for me. Is there anything else with easier kanji?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eHmm.... Let’s see.... How about “Isshinfuran”? It means, “To focus on one thing and push forward”. Ruby thinks the kanji is easy too\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eI think I can write that one! Not to mention the meaning is also cool. For me, it would mean “To keep moving forward as a school idol”. Thank you, Ruby-chan!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eEhehe. Then, let’s write it together! After we’re finished, let’s go show it to onee-chan. Onee-chan said that she’s preparing some red bean soup with mochi, so\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eRed bean soup!! Uwaaah.... Even though I need to focus on one thing, I’m already distracted~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
