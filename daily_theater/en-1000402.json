I’m kind of nervous now....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI-, I’m sorry for being so stiff....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eNo, no! Since you went and asked me properly, I’ll give a proper answer too! Umm, first of all, I’m really looking forward to the upcoming Shuffle Festival! Each of our first songs contains everything about us when we just started as school idols. To be able to sing such an important song makes me nervous, but also excited for it! I’ll work hard to make everyone feel “Ah, this song also sounds good when Ayumu sings it.”!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eFufu, that answer is very like you, Ayumu-san.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEhehe, though maybe it would be more interesting if I gave an unexpected answer....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eNot at all! Your sincerity is one of your greatest points, Ayumu-san! Please stay that way!
