What kind of thing could that be!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eWouldn’t it be better if you had invited Honoka and Kotori instead\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003e….I strictly told both of them to not drink or eat too much before, so it’s a little bit hard to say….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eThat’s why you invited me instead!?
