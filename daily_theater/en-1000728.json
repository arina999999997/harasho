Why the long face?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eAh, Ai-san. It’s nothing. I was just thinking that it’s so peaceful today.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003e....Did something happen? Did Kaoruko-sensei do something bad again?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eThis was back during New Year’s, but.... She said she’s making a special boxed dish with specialties from around the world. However, only she could make it as no one else had visited those countries. Our kitchen was like a different world entirely at the end, as if a disaster had struck it. And this was just after we did our New Year’s cleaning, mind you....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eA different world, huh? It must’ve been a scary sight to see, even for me....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eShe also woke me up and told me to get on her bike just to watch the first sunrise of the year....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eO-, oh.... That’s Kaoruko-sensei for you.... You look somewhat happy, though, Shiotti?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eWell, a lot happened, but it’s been a while since I got to spend New Year’s with her....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAh, so that’s it! It must’ve been a blast, right, Shiotti? You’re still Kaoruko-sensei’s little sister, after all. That face you made was just you being hungry for some spice in your life, huh~♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eEeeh!? No, it wasn’t! There’s no way that’s true! What are you grinning for, Ai-san!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
