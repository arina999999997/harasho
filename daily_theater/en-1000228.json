If we’re going to do a triathlon then Rin will already be good at it nya. Umm, Rin saw Kayochin doing a dance training with Eli-chan, so Rin wanted to do something too\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eEli and Hanayo did?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eYeah. It’s probably for the pool-based live that Honoka-chan and Kayochin thought of, though….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eI see…. So that’s what this is about.

If that’s the case, then we’ll have to start the training over, Rin\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eEh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0004/\u003eIf that’s what you think of me, Rin, then I need to come up with an even greater training program. Let’s reassemble the plan again!! I'm fired up now!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eNyaa-!
