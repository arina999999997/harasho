I wonder…. Maybe it’s the fact that there’s no contest for cows and sheep\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eContest for cows and sheep?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eYes. Every year near where I used to live we have a contest to decide which cows and sheep are the best~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eHow is the best decided zura?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0208/\u003eUmm, physique, how big it is is obvious, elegance of their faces, how gallant it looks while standing, it’s decided through things like that!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eElegance…. Gallant….
