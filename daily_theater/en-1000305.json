What do you think, Riko-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eFufu, you packed a lot huh, Ruby-chan\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eAh, maybe it would be hard to eat if Ruby puts this much in? Would the sandwich fall apart....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eIt’ll be okay! You just have to wrap it with a cooking sheet and cut it in half from the top of the wrapper. If you do that then it won’t dirty your hand and it would let you eat the contents without it spilling them\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eWaaah! Then can Ruby pack more in?

Should we make some snack sandwiches too?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eSnack sandwiches....?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0102/\u003eThat’s right. Have you ever seen a fruit sandwich being sold in a convenience store? Let’s make one with mikan and banana!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eT-, that sounds delicious~!
