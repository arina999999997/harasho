What’s wrong!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eThere are so many things I want to do, but I don’t have enough time to do them all! Hey, hey. Ayumu, take a look at this. What should I prioritize?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eWow...... you do have a lot of things you want to do.
