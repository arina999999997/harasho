Have you decided on what to do for Respect for the Aged Day?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eThat’s it! Ai was gonna ask you about it, Zuramaru-chan~. Ai is still wondering what to do, have you decided yet, Zuramaru-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eMaru is still wondering too zura~. It's this month so Maru thinks Maru needs to make a decision quickly, but….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eWhat have you done so far?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eUmm, Maru has given them a lot of the classic shoulder massage tickets…. But they have never used it even once~. Even though Maru is always ready for them\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eIt’s the same for me! My grands don’t really use them too…. Even though Ai gave them hundreds of tickets so they don’t feel worried that they’re going to run out….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eMaru has given them flowers, sweets, teas, and even matching teacups too zura….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eHmm-.... Alright, Zuramaru-chan, let’s do a guerilla plan this year!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eA guerilla plan? Maru isn’t really good with dangerous things….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAhaha, sorry, sorry. Ai didn’t mean to make it sound menacing. It’s something like, first, we give them a shoulder and waist massage, then we’ll suddenly take them out to eat anmitsu! When we get back, we give them a back massage using our feet. What do you think?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eSo we just do whatever comes to mind, right? Then that might be a good idea~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
