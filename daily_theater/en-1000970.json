I didn’t know that this was a thing.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eI also only found out recently. I’ve been searching up a lot of things about cats ever since I met Hanpen.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eFufu, I see. So, where are you taking me now?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eIt’s a temple dedicated to lucky cats. Legend says that a lord was invited to take shelter inside the temple by a beckoning cat when he was caught out during a thunderstorm......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eI didn’t know there was such a temple.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eThe white cat figurines you can get there look like Hanpen, so I wanted to put one in our clubroom as decoration.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eThat sounds like a great idea. Maybe I should get one for our clubroom too.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eYes, by all means! The lucky cats sold here raise their right hands and don’t hold a gold coin, unlike the ones elsewhere. You can get one with a green bandana to invite energy for growth.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eReally? That’s very interesting. Meeting everyone in µ’s helped me grow. Meeting Nijigaku, Aqours, and everyone who cheers me on also helped me grow. It seems like getting one would help me keep growing.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0210/\u003eThat’s right. With the power of green, we’ll be able to grow more and more!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
