We’re going to cook a dish fu~ll of the flavors of Autumn, after all.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eWhat shall we make? Maybe some cupcakes, pound cakes, or cookies. Scones and puddings would also be nice....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eIt’s not sweets, but Kanata wants to try making a kind of soup. There’s this French dish called Chestnut Potage~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eChestnut Potage? I’ve never heard of that before.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0206/\u003eKanata saw it on TV.
