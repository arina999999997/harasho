Hmm~, which beads should we go with?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eWaah, this crystal one is so cute~\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eYou're right! These may sparkle beautifully depending on lighting, so pretty.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eYeah. I can see them looking like glowing water splashes. Refreshing and all sparkly.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eGlowing water splashes....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eKotori-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003e....That's it, Hanayo-chan! That's a great idea! Since the theme for our next outfit is \"Summer\", we can use these crystal beads all over the costume as water droplets to make it look like the midsummer ocean.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0003/\u003eThen it would sparkle like water splashing on the beach.... Ah, then maybe we could also use a light blue or blue tulle to represent the waves.... Hanayo-chan, let's go look at fabrics one more time!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEh, huh, Kotori-chan!?
