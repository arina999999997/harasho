Huh, is it just you two, Ayumu, Settsu?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eAh, Ai-chan, perfect timing.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eAi-san, look at these!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eHm? What are those~? ....Pictures of everyone?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eThat’s right. I was walking with that person in the courtyard the other day during lunch break. Then we saw Karin-san, Emma-san, and Kanata-san napping peacefully, so I couldn’t help but take this picture.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eThis picture was from when Shizuku-san and the others took their revenge on Kasumi-san by tying her hair into a topknot for a prank Kasumi-san did. Fufu, Kasumi-san seems really embarrassed here, but this hairstyle was cute too.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eFufu, each of these pictures is just great, huh. They have this “youth!” feeling to them.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eYeah. I’ve been looking through other pictures we took so far with Setsuna-chan, and we’ve been talking about making an album with them.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAi agrees! Ai wants to leave a record of our youth~!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eIt’s decided then! So, let’s begin choosing the pictures right away.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eAh, wait, hold on! Since we decided to do it, let’s also take a picture together!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eYou mean, right now? There’s nothing special going on, but is that okay?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eIt’s probably fine. You always want to remember moments where you had fun, after all. Fufu, let’s take one with the 3 of us! I want to show this picture of us to everyone as well, Setsuna-chan, Ai-chan♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
