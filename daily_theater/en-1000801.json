Phew, you really get nervous when you’re about to do something you’re not used to, huh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0209/\u003eBut aren’t you the one who wanted to do live streams, Maki-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0006/\u003eNot really. This kind of thing doesn’t suit me. But Rin and Hanayo said they wanted to try it.
