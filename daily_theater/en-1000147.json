Are you asleep?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eNo, Maru is still up. Or rather, Maru isn’t really sleepy….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby isn’t sleepy either. Ruby is so happy to sleep over at Hanamaru-chan’s house that Ruby’s eyes are wide open….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eEhehe. Maru is the same zura. Usually we have everyone around, so it’s rare to have a quiet sleepover\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eYeah, that’s right. There’s practice tomorrow, though, so we need to go to sleep quickly….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eBut you’re just not getting sleepy, right? Hey, Ruby-chan, want to just talk a little bit more?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eRuby was going to say that too! ….Ah, that was a little loud. Sorry\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0107/\u003eI think Maru’s family is already asleep, so let’s talk quietly. That’s right, Ruby-chan, hop into Maru’s futon. We can talk easier that way zura\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0109/\u003eThen….
