Maybe I should’ve worn thicker clothes\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eEli-chaan! Eli-chan, Eli-chan, sorry to keep you waiting nya!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eAah, Rin....Huh! Wait! What’s with that getup!?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eEh? Is it weird nya? Rin bought this outfit with Honoka-chan during the new year’s sale, though....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eYou told me that story many times already, and I think it looks good on you. But that’s not the point, you’re practically baring your legs and neck. Isn’t it cold? I’m worried that you’ll catch a cold\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eEeh, but aren’t our uniforms like this too? The skirt is especially cold, you know?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003eThat might be true.... But we’re going to watch at an outdoor stage today, right? It’s not indoors, so it’s better to have more protection from the cold....\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eIt’s fine nya! Rin also thought about it properly. When we watch a school idol’s live, we cannot sit still and have to cheer for them, right? Then you’ll get hot and start to sweat. If you leave the sweat just like that, you’ll be more likely to catch a cold, so this getup is right nya!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0002/\u003e....Well, you do have a point\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0005/\u003eRight? Come on, Eli-chan, you shouldn’t be that stuffy nya!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
