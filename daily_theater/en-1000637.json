Your black cat costume also looks good on you, Hanayo-chan. You’re matching with Rin-chan and Maki-chan, right?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eYeah! The three of us made them together. I wonder when everyone else will come.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eThat’s right, hey, are you prepared for the prank?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0008/\u003eEh? Y-, yeah, more or less.... But I’m sure Nozomi-chan and the others have already prepared sweets, so we probably won’t be able to do it, no?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eHmm....
