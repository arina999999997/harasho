Sorry, did you wait long?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eNo, I’ve just arrived too. Let’s go right away then. Have you decided on what you want, Ai-chan?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eHmm…. Actually, Ai still doesn’t really know…. Man, Settsu is just too good at promoting the stuff she likes, isn’t she? She makes you interested and want to check it out, and when you check it out for real, it’s actually 100% interesting…. She gets me into more and more stuff-!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eAhaha, she really is. Actually, I don’t know what to buy either…. Plus, it’s my first time going to a character themed food truck so I’m not sure if what I buy will be good or not….\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0205/\u003eHmm….

If we have Setsuna-chan here, I’ll feel relieved\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
