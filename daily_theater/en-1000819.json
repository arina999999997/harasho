After all, Setsuna-chan wants to do it.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eAlright then. Putting on a play as part of our live concert sounds fun.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eThank you so much!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eSo, what kind of play should we perform?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eI’ve already decided! It’ll be about something I love!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eI can already guess that Setsuna-chan wants to do a superhero show. What kind of heroes will we be playing?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eEhehe, it’s kind of embarrassing to play a superhero......\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eNope, this time it’ll be different.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eEh?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eActually, despite the countless number of superhero shows that I’ve watched before, there’s something that I haven’t paid attention to before until now...... the monsters, they’re so fascinating!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003eYou find the monsters fascinating......?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0203/\u003eI see...... Come to think of it, there have been more shows recently where they focus more on the portrayal of the monsters. The dark hero genre has been getting more and more popular lately.\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0207/\u003eRight. In order for a hero to shine, they need to have worthy opponents! I’m trying to research precisely what makes those monsters so fascinating!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0201/\u003e......Understood! Let’s do it!!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0000/\u003eTranslated by SIFAStheatre and Idol Story\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e"}
