I figured since we’re getting so much snow, I might as well try making the biggest one around♪\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eThat’s nice and all, but your hands are turning red. Aren’t they cold?\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0001/\u003eAh, you’re right.... But my body is warm from moving around a bunch, so it’ll be fine!\u003c:dt_line_end/\u003e\u003c:th_ch0103/\u003eIs that how it works....? Give me your hands for a second. Uwaah, they’re freezing!
